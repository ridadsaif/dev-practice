We will continue to need fossil fuels in our energy mix for decades to come and as such, we need to ensure that the fossil fuels we do consume are of the lowest possible carbon intensity and impact on our planet. With the advent of big data and the Internet of Things (IOT) we can use things like blockchain technology to be able to track and monitor the impact of the carbon we consume.

ESG compliance has become an increasingly hot topic throughout 2019. As investors become more in tune with ESG requirements, miners are reacting to ensure they stay up to date and avoid any backlash.

“A heightened public focus on reducing carbon emissions could prompt state legislators and regulators to accelerate the pace of the power sector’s transition to renewable energy sources. If we were to assume that declining coal-fired generation is replaced by a mix of 20% natural gas and 80% renewable generation (instead of the 60% natural gas/40% renewable mix assumed in our base case), the result would be a net reduction in CO2 emissions of 650 million tons, instead of 532 million tons, representing a 35% reduction from 2018 emissions by 2030,” Moody’s said.

When analyzing environmental, social, and governance factors, the “G” element is often forgotten amid considerations over climate risk, societal implications and other “E” and “S” risks and opportunities. However, understanding governance risks and opportunities in decision-making is critical, as poor corporate governance practices have stood at the core of some of the biggest corporate scandals.

Agriculture can in some ways be environmentally beneficial. Using biofuels--when plant products are used in biofuel, gasoline, or diesel and mixed with oils from certain agricultural products--helps reduce the total consumption of fossil fuels.

There is approximately 1.1 million megawatts of installed generation capacity of all types that are available to the US grid. Between 2010 and the first quarter of 2019, US power companies announced the retirement of more than 546 coal-fired power units, totaling about 102,000 MW of generating capacity, according to the US Energy Information Administration.

We have been exploring the “G” component of ESG, and many tech companies in general do not score favorably on the governance front. In a previous blog, we provided a breakdown of the various elements or dimensions that are part of the S&P Dow Jones Indices’ governance score.

Social factors don't just depend on how consumers will judge a company’s behavior. Geopolitical events also fall under the social category in ESG investing and conflicts like these can prevent companies from producing or distributing their products.

In addition to enhancing investors' abilities to analyze companies in general, AI provides companies more power to analyze everything for which they can collect data. This expansiveness is expected to create some challenges for companies that wish to perform well on ESG metrics as they grapple with how to manage this evolving technology.

Based on RobecoSAM’s definition, the governance score is referred to as the economic dimension score (EDS), as it evaluates the corporate governance performance of companies but includes additional key measurements that evaluate the quality of a company’s management systems as well as its ability to manage long-term risks and opportunities. In order to understand the G component of ESG and how it affects stock performance, it is helpful to delve deeper into what constitutes good governance.

S&P Global (NYSE: SPGI) and RobecoSAM, an affiliate of Robeco, announced today that S&P Global will acquire the ESG Ratings Business from RobecoSAM which includes the widely followed SAM* Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA) – an annual evaluation of companies' sustainability practices. The CSA is recognized as one of the most advanced ESG scoring methodologies, as it draws upon 20 years of experience analyzing sustainability's impact on a company's long-term value creation.

The first rationale is that from a risk/return perspective, companies that consider impact investing and ESG practices associated with their business activities are likely to be ahead of their peers.1 From an environmental standpoint, actively managing a portfolio’s footprint may help decrease exposure to companies that may face legal and reputational risks and provide a hedge against future regulatory changes. For example, as the world transitions to a low-carbon economy, organizations that have been proactive will be better positioned to adapt to new regulations, innovation, or a shift in consumer appetite.2

As the benefits of gender-diverse leadership become ignorable, public companies will continue to face pressure from investors to act accordingly. The first episode of our Change Pays podcast explores how S&P Global’s Women’s Research Council assigned gender to data through a proprietary algorithm that is now in the process of being developed into a potential product by Kensho.

Houston — A Colorado-based wind farm developer has secured tax equity and construction debt for a 130-MW facility it is building in Indiana that will supply 80% of its renewable energy capacity under a 15-year power purchase agreement to Exelon Energy subsidiary Constellation, the developer said.

Patrick Murphy, Managing Director of private equity firm AMCI Capital LP, which has its foundations in steel markets and prefers bulk commodities and base metals, was cautious on critical minerals due to opaque markets and the potential for supply to easily overtake demand.

After tailings dam failures at Mount Polley in 2014, Samarco in 2015 and Feijao in January 2019, the Church of England Pensions Board and the Swedish Council on Ethics urging 683 listed miners to publicly release information on all of their tailings dams was a "game-changing moment" for tailings research, she said.

Russian nuclear generation is cost-competitive vis-à-vis that of other fuel types, thanks to relatively low construction costs, low additional nuclear-related costs, and high capacity utilization. Nuclear output is sold at prevailing market prices, which effectively depend on gas-fired and coal-fired generation costs, but result in solid profitability for nuclear generation.

We recognize the merits of the circular economy as businesses seek to align their sustainability strategies with wider social goals articulated by the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In our view, sustainable infrastructure and circular economy initiatives could directly support the private sector's pursuit towards the SDGs (see sidebar 2).

Our economic forecast calls for continued growth in 2020, but the slower pace of growth may cause some states to feel like they are in a recession. The challenges of an economy growing at less than 2% will present itself on both the revenue and expenditure sides of the budget.

Measuring the performance of an index requires a continuous and uninterrupted time series. Each reactivation instance of a Child Index signifies a new time series, and any historical data prior to that reactivation date should be treated as a separate time series.

Three years ago, S&P took control of environmental data and risk analysis provider Trucost, now part of its Market Intelligence unit. The company revealed Nov. 21 that it will also acquire RobecoSAM AG's ESG ratings and Corporate Sustainability Assessment business.

Private equity investors are paying increasing attention to environmental, social and governance issues and in response, many firms are implementing strategies to ensure portfolio companies are screened against ESG factors. This focus is likely to intensify and could become a requirement for a fund over time, representatives from some of the world's most prominent private equity firms say in the latest episode of ESG Insider, an S&P Global podcast.

Institutional investors have increasingly been applying ESG criteria to their investment policies, with a view to reducing financial risk and providing better returns over the longer term. ESG-related funds have mushroomed, as has the issuance of green and social bonds, debt that finances environmentally friendly and socially aware projects.

There can be no doubt that the cycle of significant climate events is increasing and that emissions of CO2 or greenhouse gases (GHGs) are rising at alarming rates. However, in a world where over 1 billion people still lack access to simple electricity and many more still live in poverty, the dual challenge of providing affordable clean energy and tackling the impacts of climate change remains complex.

In 2018, Japan’s Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) selected two of our carbon-efficient indices for its ESG investment portfolio—the S&P/JPX Carbon Efficient Index for Japanese equities, and the S&P Global Ex-Japan LargeMidCap Carbon Efficient Index for non-Japanese equities. As of the March 2019 rebalance, the S&P/JPX Carbon Efficient Index recorded a 21% decrease in GHG emissions intensity over the one-year period, while the S&P Global Ex-Japan LargeMidCap Carbon Efficient Index reduced its carbon exposure by approximately 34% over the same period, compared with its benchmark.

Audrey Choi: Especially if you're an investor who is a bit hesitant or skeptical about ESG altogether, I think first of all, it's really important to just sort of take that head on and first say, Okay, so why is it that you're hesitant about ESG? If you're like many investors, in fact, they are the majority of investors, you're probably going to say, 'Look, I agree with all the great goals of environmental protection and social justice and good governance.

Challis said it is understandable that there are doubts around the private sector genuinely participating in the housing sector with social purpose. "The long shadow of corporate self-interest as demonstrated by the global financial crisis means that the public sector is naturally skeptical of institutional money taking a return, a profit, for providing affordable housing."

Moreover, Trucost’s physical risk dataset is used to reduce the physical risks of climate change by understanding how a company’s assets are exposed to physical risks. This allows for a more holistic view on climate risk, wherein if the world does not transition, even companies that are aligned with a 1.5°C scenario will be exposed to physical risks, which this index aims to hedge.

As the finance world continues to clamp down on coal producers over climate change concerns, producers focused on metallurgical coal used in steelmaking are pushing to stand out from peers mining coal used to generate electricity.

As companies make progress factoring climate risk into their business strategies, the specifics of environmental, social and corporate governance policies are taking shape. However, continuing to educate institutions remains important and many questions remain, including how to best assess investments in private companies not subject to reporting requirements and to the commodities space, according to experts at S&P Global Market Intelligence's "Accelerating Progress on Climate Risk" event at the New York Stock Exchange March 2.

The S&P Europe 350 ESG Factor Weighted Index is designed to measure the performance of the constituent companies within the S&P Europe 350®, with a weighting scheme that accounts for each company?€?s ESG Factor Score, as assessed by SAM.

An opportunity is knocking at the door of companies in Latin America. SAM, part of S&P Global[1] and a global leader in ESG data, published the SAM Corporate Sustainability Assessment Latin America Progress Report 2019, which revealed that, on average, Latin American companies only have one female director on their board of directors.

In January 2020, S&P Dow Jones Indices (S&P DJI) released a paper for the S&P Eurozone Paris-Aligned Climate Index Concept (PAC Concept). The PAC Concept conceptualizes the proposals of the EU Technical Expert Group on Sustainable Finance (TEG), as published in its Final Report on Climate Benchmarks and Benchmarks’ ESG Disclosure dated September 2019,[1] for the Paris-aligned benchmark and incorporates transition risk, physical risk, and climate opportunities, as laid out by the TCFD[2] (see Exhibit 1).

Because these indices are new, however, it is important to acknowledge that three- and five-year return figures include history that was built before these indices launched in early 2019, as noted in the methodology. For this reason, investors should pay special attention to the past year or so, when the indices were live.

The demand from investors for environment, social, and governance (ESG) data and ESG products has never been stronger. This has triggered a growing industry of ESG data providers in the market.

We see Transnet's management and governance as fair, and more exposed to governance factors than domestic peers'. Transnet's former board and executive team have been accused of significant governance failures and irregularities, most notably in procurement.

We see ESG factors for CBA to be broadly in line with those for its industry and domestic peers. In our view, CBA has a comprehensive and well-developed risk management and governance framework across the group's activities.

We believe that Bayer needs to manage risks from its legacy products to maintain credit quality. In its pharma division, the company settled lawsuits in the U.S. on its best-selling drug Xarelto in 2019.

Social risks for airports are, in our view, somewhat above average compared to other industries. Airports usually operate under concession because this business is generally monopolistic and highly related to public mobility, as well as economic development.

The ability to provide ancillary, value-added services, while at the same time reducing service costs, are key success factors for this business segment. While we think that pressure from politicians, regulators, and competitors will remain high, we believe Enel is well equipped to address them.

We see FedEx as facing significant environmental risk, similar to the rest of the package express industry, principally because of the long-term industry trend toward tighter regulation of GHG emissions, which could increase its costs over time. That said, a portion of FedEx's vehicle fleet uses alternative fuels, which provide increased fuel efficiency (including hybrid, electric, compressed or liquefied natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, and hydrogen-fueled vehicles).

Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks are embedded in our project finance ratings and considered in our analysis and forecasts in our construction phase and operations phase assessments, as well as in our transaction structure criteria.

While the company's positions relative to ESG factors are largely in line with the industry, we expect environmental and social risk factors to increasing influence GM's credit quality as it invests heavily in vehicle and greenhouse gas emissions control, improved fuel economy, electrification, autonomous vehicles, driver and passenger safety, and urban mobility. The company's R&D expenses in 2018 were $7.8 billion, up over 7% from 2017 levels and up 18% from 2016 levels.

We consider Boeing, which derived about 70% of its revenue from commercial aerospace and 30% from defense prior to the MAX grounding, to have a greater exposure to social risks than other A&D companies due to the significant impact product safety can have on the company’s financial and competitive positions. The near-term impact of the 737 MAX grounding, following two airline crashes, has certainly been material.

We view JCI's ESG risks to be largely in line with those of most large, global capital goods peers. In our view, the company has a good track record of identifying and mitigating ESG risks.

Amcor is a global packaging company with close to 250 sites in more than 40 countries. The company develops and produces packaging solutions for food, beverage, pharmaceutical, medical-device, home- and personal-care, and other products.

FONPLATA largely finances infrastructure projects in its five member countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. These countries are exposed to environmental risks because natural disasters, such as river flooding, wildfire, and deforestation, can damage infrastructure.

We believe North American Weyerhaeuser's credit quality is more exposed to risks from environmental factors than the broader industry, due largely to potential long-term effects of climate change on the company's 12 million acres of timber assets. Maintaining healthy and sustainable forest lands is core to Weyerhaeuser's viability to ensure a reliable permanent source of timber.

We view environmental and social risk factors for PVH as broadly in line with industry peers'. We also consider investments related to sustainable operations a necessary cost for PVH to remain competitive as consumers are increasingly aware of their consumption-related environmental impact.

Although ViacomCBS Inc. is a new company created through the merger of CBS Corp. and Viacom Inc., it is more exposed to governance risks than its media peers. Its corporate and governance structure, like its predecessor companies, gives its controlling shareholder significant influence over the company.

In our view, Ageas' exposure to environmental and social risks is similar to that of the global insurance industry and peers in continental Europe, such as Vienna Insurance Group or CNP Assurances. Environmental risk primarily arises from the risk that the frequency and severity of claims for extreme weather events will increase as a result of climate change in its main markets of Belgium, Portugal, and the U.K. Further exposure stems from Ageas' investment portfolio, where changes in policy or public opinion regarding climate change could cause greater asset valuation volatility.

We see ArcelorMittal's exposure to ESG risks as in line with that of the metal & mining industry. Similar to other steel producers, the company has a large carbon footprint.

We believe ESG credit factors at Bank of America Corp. (BAC) are broadly in line with those of industry and U.S. peers. We consider governance factors, and to a lesser extent social ones, more relevant than environmental risks.

We see ESG credit factors for SocGen to be broadly in line with that of the industry and country peers. We think that the group's diversified and international business profile leaves it exposed to a wide range of nonfinancial risks, notably reputational, compliances or operational ones.

All regions of the U.S. will be affected by population aging as every state's old-age dependency ratio will increase. Across the four Census regions, more acute credit risks present themselves.

Despite these actions, low interest rates remain a risk for insurers. Average coupon rates on bonds are still declining by about 20 basis points per year in many markets, further undercutting insurers' returns on investment.

Etisalat's exposure to ESG risk factors is comparable with the broader telecom sector. Its exposure to governance and environmental risks is the most notable, but not currently a rating driver.

Australia-headquartered international building product and construction material group Boral has above-average exposure to environmental risks, given that its operations are resource-intensive, including various quarrying activities and cement operations. At sites where the company extracts natural resources or manufacture products, it has obligations related to site rehabilitation or clean-up of contamination.

Assured's ESG risks are line with those of the broader insurance sector. The most predominant of these risks is the sector’s exposure to natural catastrophes and the effect these events have on lease and revenue streams backing insured issues, as well as lower assessed property values due to weather-related property damage.

Over the next decade, spatial finance may enhance our environmental, social, and governance analysis by linking information about ecosystems and societies directly to companies' financial metrics.

We view SNC's management and governance as fair only, and less supportive when compared to the broader E&C industry. This primarily reflects cost overruns on a project to construct sulfuric acid plants at a copper mine in Chile and two infrastructure projects in Canada that led to significant losses realized in the fourth quarter of 2018 and first half of 2019.

We see Enbridge as having somewhat higher exposure to environmental risk than peers because it faces strict global and domestic environmental policies that make it increasingly challenging for it to construct new pipeline projects on time and within budget and manage operations. These challenges are heightened for Enbridge given its large pipeline network.

We view Equifax as being more exposed to governance risk factors than its peers, but assess management and governance as fair, reflecting several actioned remediation efforts. Given the private and sensitive nature of the information they handle, credit bureaus such as Equifax are highly exposed to governance risks surrounding the protection of confidential data.

Overall, life insurers in Taiwan have moderate exposure to environmental and social risks, and we believe Nan Shan Life's exposures are in line with the industry and those of its closest peers. Recent disputes on governance structures, including over the IT (Envision Project) incident that led the regulator to suspend sales of investment-linked insurance products since late September 2019, are reflected in our rating assessments.

We view the environmental and social considerations for Nutrien as being in line with its industry peers. As fertilizer production generates significant GHG emissions, Nutrien’s GHG management practices have the potential to materially affect its credit profile and rating.

ESG factors are becoming increasingly relevant for the banking industry, reflecting heightened scrutiny from multiple stakeholders as well as evolving regulatory and operational environment, with associated risks and opportunities for individual banks. Whereas topics like climate change, treating customers fairly, ensuring proper governance, and transparency rank increasingly higher on many boards' agendas, embedding ESG considerations into business settings or risk frameworks takes time, especially in determining how banks will support the transition to a carbon-neutral economy.

Ameren Missouri's (AM's) credit quality is more negatively influenced by environmental risk factors than global peers given its heavy reliance on coal-fired generation and its associated carbon footprint. AM operates a vertically integrated electric utility and is a natural gas utility distributor.

Climate is often the top issue for investors when considering ESG issues. This has long been recognized by S&P DJI, as we launched the S&P Global Carbon Efficient Index Series back in 2009.

These beta-like indices gave investors’ comfort that they could integrate ESG into the core of their portfolios. Was this warm feeling deserved?

"The outlook revisions have been predicated on a combination of factors, including uncertainty surrounding the local service area economy in light of the recession," said S&P Global Ratings credit analyst Edward McGlade. While these outlook revisions apply to credits that previously carried positive outlooks, they correspond with the negative outlook revision we took on the entire Public Utilities Sector on April 1, 2020, which highlighted the sector's vulnerability to the potential negative economic effects presented by the COVID-19 pandemic.

ESG IN THE TIME OF COVID-19

In recent years, socially responsible investing has gained importance worldwide. There has been a paradigm shift in investment strategy globally, whereby the number of market participants who have become socially conscious and want to hold investments in companies that acknowledge the relevance of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors in doing business has significantly increased.

Costco (+6.98% YTD) is a similar case study. The S&P 500 ESG index excluded the stock entirely because Costco’s ESG score was too low relative to its industry group.

"There remains an exceptional level of uncertainty regarding the near-term outlook for [oil] prices and product demand. There is the risk of more sustained consequences depending on the efforts of governments and the public and private sectors to manage the health, economic, and financial stability effects of the pandemic,” BP Plc CEO Bernard Looney said while announcing the company’s first-quarter earnings.

It's annual shareholder meeting season, with support for ESG concerns put to the test at a time when many meetings are being held remotely because of the coronavirus.

The coronavirus pandemic is expected to decimate energy demand across the world by 6% this year, an "unprecedented decline" that will hit hardest in advanced economies including the U.S. and Europe, the International Energy Agency said April 30. The forecast would mean energy demand — most significantly for coal, oil and gas — is set to decline at seven times the rate seen after the global financial crisis of 2008, a drop on par with losing the entire energy demand of India.

The ESG Lens On COVID-19, Part 1, April 20, 2020

ESG Evaluations are our view of an entity's capacity to operate successfully in the future and may be affected by the risks and disruptions caused by COVID-19. The ESG Evaluation comprises two assessments: the ESG profile considers near-term and observable risks and opportunities, and an entity's preparedness considers its ability to manage emerging, disruptive, and strategic risks.

Pandemic and price-related factors could potentially lead to a copper mine supply loss of over 10% in 2020, or more than 2 million mt, he said. Adding to this, falling copper inventories in China and current indications of a tightness in copper scrap – which typically accounts for one third of global copper supplies – could push copper prices back to their pre-coronavirus levels of over $6,000/mt, according to Sobotka.

Singapore's oil trading, bunkering sectors and banking system remains resilient despite the challenges posed by a drop in global demand for energy as well as developments related to Hin Leong Trading, a joint statement by Enterprise Singapore, Monetary Authority of Singapore, and the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore said late Tuesday.

“There are debates going on around the edges, but I think everybody agrees on the importance of ESG,” said one senior investor. “You'd hope that everyone agrees that this direction is a positive one.

A partial recovery in European power prices is expected between 2021 and 2023 as demand rebounds and more coal and nuclear power plants are shut down, but forecast prices are now about 20% below November 2019 estimates, S&P Global Ratings said June 9. This was despite a drastic cut in French nuclear power production rates over the next three years, the ratings agency said in a semi-annual report.

As the leveraged finance markets move to embrace sustainability issues, Europe has seen a handful of green high-yield bonds over recent years, but the European leveraged loan space has been slower to adapt. Last year, Spanish telco MASMOVIL Group became the first leveraged loan borrower in Europe to incorporate ESG criteria into its financing, with a €100 million revolver and a €150 million capex line both including an ESG rating from a third-party provider with a linked margin ratchet.

S&P Global Ratings strives to provide the financial markets with timely, transparent, and forward-looking credit ratings. Through this unprecedented time, S&P Global Ratings continues to engage with borrowers, investors, and other market participants to better understand the credit effects of the coronavirus-related economic shock.

“Across the U.S. in recent weeks, there have been a number of deeply disturbing events that have shaken us. Videos of unspeakable behavior have brought home in shocking fashion the inequality and fear some in our communities deal with on a daily basis,” Wells Fargo CEO Charles Scharf wrote in an email to the bank’s employees.

With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic earlier this year, companies around the world have faced the gravest disruption in more than a generation, with a variety of sectors facing an existential threat amid a severe economic downturn--an uncertain prospect given the mixed signals on policy and challenges forecasting the spread of a novel disease. Even once the recovery is underway, there will be enduring and irreversible changes to the relationship between companies and their employees.

It is increasingly evident that all generations wish to educate themselves on how to make ESG investment decisions and how to best align their investment objectives with their values. However, an additional objective shared by baby boomers, Gen Xers, and millennials alike is that aligning investments with their values not come at the cost of investment performance.

Late last summer, nearly 200 chief executives (S&P Global’s own CEO, Doug Peterson, included) put their signatures on a new statement of the purpose of a corporation,[1] one focused not only on shareholder value, but on value for all key stakeholders.

The Fed's recent bond-buying bulletin stoked already red-hot conditions for the U.S. high-yield market, contributing to record-smashing volume of issuance last week and a monthly record for June. Deals that printed on Friday for Eldorado Resorts Inc. ($5.2 billion) and Caesars Entertainment Corp. ($1 billion), backing the combination of the two entities, boosted last week’s issuance to $23.53 billion, blowing past the prior record of $21.6 billion for the week to Aug. 13, 2010, per LCD, which began tracking this asset class in 2005.

Podcast: Why S&P Global Ratings sees ESG as critical to COVID-era credit quality

Today is Thursday, June 25, 2020, and here is today’s essential intelligence.

Even if, according to the European Commission, this is still too little to bridge the required investment gap of 1.5% of GDP per year to meet 2030 carbon-reduction goals, it is a huge improvement from the €7.5 billion of "fresh money" announced in the Green Deal (see "Related Research" below). The proposed EU budget also contains a pledge to "do no harm", for which the recently approved EU Green Taxonomy would presumably be leveraged, helping reinforce the EU's environment-friendly strategy (see "Sidebar: Taxonomy Regulation Aims To Boost Private Sector Investment In Green And Sustainable Projects").

The services sector faces modest inherent social risks, but the heterogeneity of business models and end-markets can result in considerable variation in social risk factors faced by individual firms at the margins. Companies may be labor-intensive, with employees operating potentially hazardous equipment or on dangerous sites, which heightens safety management risks.

The sheer scale of demonstrations against racism and social injustice after George Floyd's death has led some corporations to publicly denounce all forms of discrimination, and we expect this will continue.

In our view, the RBNZ's onsite supervision capabilities are less comprehensive than those of jurisdictions such as Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Canada, which we view as strong. That said, we believe that the RBNZ's focus on self-discipline, market discipline, and the close involvement of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) in the regulation of the New Zealand major banks to an extent counterbalances some of the gaps in on-site supervision.

We have updated our ESG Risk Atlas, the foundation of our ESG Evaluation analysis, to strengthen the quality of our sector analysis.

As with any medicine, vaccines have safety risks like unexpected immune side effects. The known side effects of existing vaccines for other ailments are probably worth the risk for most populations, except possibly children, given the alternative of a COVID-19 infection.

The rating on Emeco Holdings Ltd. principally reflects the company's small size globally, capital-intensive operations, and narrow focus on heavy earthmoving mining equipment rental services. Further, Emeco's cash flows can be highly volatile given its exposure to commodity cycles and limited contractual protections.

We assume that the public and governments expect that a vaccine would be affordable. Governments are providing funding for the vaccine, and to reach herd immunity the majority of the population needs to be vaccinated.

State agencies (as well as health care providers) increasingly acknowledge the role SDOH play in patients' health status and health care costs, particularly because SDOH disproportionately affect low-income individuals, many of whom are served by Medicaid. Recently, the Social Determinants Accelerator Act, bi-partisan federal legislation, was introduced to assist states and communities in coordinating programs that address social determinants, to improve the health and well-being of individuals participating in Medicaid.

Panelists agreed that Europe is leading the way in adapting the structured finance market to ESG considerations and there have been numerous supportive signals from various EU regulators, although the market is still in its infancy. There are two key challenges: the lack of assets available for securitization and the lack of common standards defining what ESG principles really mean.

Governance stands out against peers as a very important risk factor for our ratings on Casino. The group has a very complex corporate and ownership structure.

SAP’s exposure to environmental and social risk factors is comparable to that of the broader technology software and services sector. Social risks mainly relate to customer privacy and data security, which could cause significant reputational harm and monetary damages to SAP if compromised.

Social risks such as building quality and labor safety are key ongoing risks for Longfor. These can lead to significant reputation damage, buyer boycott and potential punitive government actions such as fines and additional regulation.

The cruise industry, including Carnival, is more exposed to environmental risks than the broader travel and leisure industry because of ship emissions; increasing environmental regulations and complexity, including the 2020 global cap on sulfur content of marine fuels; and potential environmental damage that could result from a ship accident. Although Carnival has occasionally incurred fines for not fully complying with environmental rules and regulations, these costs have not materially increased financial risk.

For decades, oil and gas producers have outsourced most of the activities associated with the lifecycle of oil or gas fields to OFS companies. We believe these companies, which provide drilling and construction and supply services, have similar above-average exposure to many of the same environment and social risks and requirements as oil and gas producers.

ESG credit factors don't influence Banco Galicia's credit quality more than those of its industry and domestic peers. The Argentinean banking system has a large share of public banks (39% of total assets) that usually have a higher social role, reaching segments of the population and small- to mid-size enterprises (SMEs) that normally private banks don't target.

In this report, we analyze the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) credit factors for select U.S. public finance (USPF) government and not-for-profit enterprise issuers in the Tri-State region of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. The list of entities highlighted in this report is not exhaustive but rather illustrative more broadly of the region's key ESG risks and opportunities and our view of where issuers across different sectors are positioned relative to those risks and opportunities.

We currently believe the city has sufficient flexibility to maintain adequate budgetary performance in the near term despite elevated fixed costs at 14% of the total governmental funds budget. Jacksonville has maintained positive operating results in its general fund since 2014 as revenue growth has outpaced expenditure growth.

Environmental and social credit factors may affect the quality of the assets in the cover pool and the results of our collateral analysis. If, in our view, an environmental or a social credit factor presents a material risk to the repayment of the rated securities, it could impact the credit enhancement required to achieve a given rating, or potentially constrain the maximum potential rating.

Whether banks will become obsolete and disappear, he says "they are vanishing before our very eyes," with a shrinking number of branches and staff. Mr. Jenkins' view is that increasingly, nonbanks will be managing the customer relationship and balance sheet activity will remain with banks—because no one else wants to do that or can because of regulation.

Since April 1, 2020, physical climate risks and an issuer's exposure to the short- and long-term effects of climate change has resulted in three downgrades and two CreditWatch negatives in U.S. public finance (USPF). Although it's a small number compared to the rated USPF universe, the long-term effects of chronic physical climate risks, such as heatwaves and water stress, will likely escalate absent sufficient adaptation actions.

This is not to imply that banks and insurers are anything other than serious about their green and sustainability objectives (and we note that all investors in green and sustainability-linked bonds are ultimately exposed to the overall business risk of the issuers), but such hybrids may not match the investment mandate of some green and sustainability investment portfolios. Given the challenges regarding specific hybrid terms, we expect that banks and insurers may be better able to tap this asset class based on the green or sustainability credentials of their broader business models than on the necessarily imperfect ring-fencing of individual hybrids.

In our view, L&Q's governance factors are weaker than peers in the U.K. social housing sector. L&Q has sales revenues comprising 45% of total turnover in FY2020, which makes it one of the most exposed entities in our portfolio.

U.S. ABCP outstanding reached a peak of approximately $272 billion between March and April partly due to a relatively inaccessible term market, the dire need for companies to access short-term liquidity, as well as issuance from newer conduits. While U.S. sponsors were able to issue during this stressed period, albeit at higher pricing and shorter tenors, there were some draws under liquidity facilities.

Costa Caldis, COO of SAFE Supply, a supply chain traceability company, told S&P Global Platts: "As the world moves towards sustainability there is no denying the fact that investors are increasingly crying out for ESG-linked vehicles to park their money. The increased requirements will incur costs for companies in terms of increased reporting and auditing.

Major cities in the U.S. have experienced fewer pandemic-related rating actions than U.S. states. Most city rating actions in the past year resulted when a precipitous decline in taxes generated by discretionary spending (sales, hotel, and gaming) led to fiscal stress or budgetary imbalances, or declining debt service coverage.

The drop in passenger volumes amid the pandemic has shown that the volume exposure of airport operators is higher than that of utility providers, for example water companies. This is why we assess airports as having higher industry risk.

The unprecedented times caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have shown that traditional credit risk analysis that uses the latest published financials for companies creates challenges in capturing the true impact of the pandemic on the economy and businesses. As an alternative, analysts can use consensus data from equity analysts to add independent views of the pandemic’s impact on businesses within each industry.

The lawsuits followed an 18-month investigation into Facebook, and came just months after regulators pursued similar action against Alphabet and other big tech firms. In October, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and 11 states filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google, accusing the engine of engaging in "anticompetitive and exclusionary practices" that illegally monopolized general search and search advertising markets.

The U.S. opioid epidemic killed 450,000 Americans from 1999-2019 in three waves marked by rises in addiction to prescription opioids such as OxyContin, illicit opioids such as heroin, and synthetic opioids including fentanyl , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Overdose deaths have quadrupled since 2009—and the COVID-19 crisis has only exacerbated the problem.

In recent years, socially responsible investing has gained importance worldwide. There has been a paradigm shift in investment strategy globally, whereby the number of market participants who have become socially conscious and want to hold investments in companies that acknowledge the relevance of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors in doing business has significantly increased.

Within equities that have exposure to green revenue of greater than 1%, the equities with the highest exposure (Quintile 1) outperform those with the lowest (Quintile 5) by 2.62% on average annually.

S&P Global Platts proposed Dec. 3 including US WTI Midland crude oil in its Dated Brent price assessments, the benchmark for North Sea light sweet crude and reference point for around two-thirds of the world's oil trade. If implemented, it would be the first time the benchmark has been broadened to include a crude oil grade from beyond the North Sea, adding around 450,000 b/d of liquidity based on recent flows of WTI Midland to Europe, at a time of declining production of some of the traditional North Sea grades.

Mining is an energy-intensive industry and it has a high emissions footprint. McKinsey & Co. estimated in January that mining is responsible for 4% to 7% of global greenhouse gas emissions in terms of the sector's Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.

New York City existed as the epicenter of the first wave of the country’s outbreak. Since March, it has reported more than 360,000 COVID-19 cases.

"Given China's pledge to stop emitting more carbons annually beyond 2030 and the long-run target of achieving 'carbon neutrality' by 2060, it is essential for Chinese national oil companies to have a green energy strategy as soon as possible," Kang Wu, Platts Analytics' Head of Global Demand, Risk, and Asia, told S&P Global Platts. "The earlier they get involved in the process, the more they will be able to take advantage of their rich energy resources at hand to drive down the cost of transition."

Many institutions have responded to the pandemic by increasingly offering more flexible working arrangements for their employees. Companies also recognize that meeting employees’ needs supports their bottom lines, and offering more family-friendly benefits tends to produce higher returns.

In the face of school and daycare closures, and with many children moving to virtual learning environments, the time required for childcare duties since the pandemic began has increased for 58% of parents, according to the survey, according to an S&P Global/AARP survey of nearly 1,600 employees at large U.S. companies conducted in late-summer. Many parents and family caregivers have reported that their at-home commitments have grown since the pandemic began, leading to increased stress levels and some feeling that they were being penalized at work for their increasing responsibilities.

Using the S&P Global ESG Score as a constraint in portfolio alignment the weighted S&P Global ESG Score of an ESG Tilted S&P 500 and ESG Tilted S&P Global 1200 portfolio increases by an average of 24% and 22% respectively, as compared to the benchmark, whilst still largely maintaining the underlying benchmark characteristics.

Those reputational risks could be sizable, as ESG investing continued to grow in the U.S. in 2020. Our Chart of the Week shows that U.S. sustainable investments surpassed $17 trillion at the outset of the year.

According to S&P Global Market Intelligence, U.S. banks’ total PPP loan balances grew in the third quarter due to lending that continued through August and a complicated forgiveness process that has been slow to start due to changing guidance and difficulties processing the loans. The federal loans accounted for 4.7% of the U.S. banking industry’s total loans and leases by Sept. 30.

The value of global assets with an environmental, social, or governance (ESG) focus topped $1 trillion in the first half of 2020, as the largest institutional investors and companies pledged to tackle climate change and address social issues. Despite this growth in ESG assets, incorporating ESG factors in equity portfolios is perceived to lead to lower returns.

Using the Trucost Paris Alignment dataset, investors can track a company’s actual and forecasted carbon intensity and how this intensity needs to be reduced by 2025 to meet the Paris Agreement Goal (to keep global temperature rise well below 2°C).

Within the S&P 500 and MSCI World, equities with the highest SDG exposure (Tertile 1) outperform those with the lowest (Tertile 3) by 2.1% and 1.6% on average annually, respectively.

But to-date, asset managers have only had a relatively small universe of investable hydrogen companies to play with. According to JJ Traynor, managing director at HydrogenOne Capital Ltd., an investment company founded this year to invest in hydrogen, there are about 15 to 20 pure-hydrogen companies in the listed space that either produce the fuel or make related component parts.

ESG stakeholders are also seeking better data when it comes to corporate diversity. As we reported earlier this month, Nasdaq proposed requiring diversity on the boards of listed companies, but how exactly do you measure things like race and sexual orientation when data is scarce or nonexistent?

The demand from investors for environmental, social, and governance (ESG) data and products has never been stronger. This reflects the increasing awareness regarding the financial materiality of ESG issues and the role they can play in impacting a company’s performance.

"This is the OCC's reaction to banks making decisions not necessarily solely on financial metrics, but also to reputational concerns related to ESG," Geiringer said. "Banks and other companies are embracing ESG because they see that the two concepts are becoming conjoined, that investors are looking for banks and other companies to embrace ESG.

The challenge for investment managers will be how to integrate climate risk successfully into M&A activity, often in the absence of sufficient climate-related disclosure. This is where asset level data and climate-risk models can help.

The August 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence Asia-Pacific Markets Newsletter is now available for your viewing. This complimentary report provides timely insights and data on the Equity, CDS, Fixed Income, M&A, IPO, Private Equity and Venture Capital Investment markets.

Held virtually, the Summer Policy Summit continued dialogue on best practices for the industry's transition to cleaner energy sources and illustrated an increased focus on inclusion and diversity within the industry's workforce. Across a two-part session, "Rekindling a dynamic, diverse and resilient energy workforce," commissioners, consultants, and utility and energy industry executives shared insights and best practices for addressing bias and racial inequity in hiring practices and in the workplace.

This year we have seen ambitious green hydrogen projects launch in Asia, Australia, Europe, the Middle East and North America. Heading into 2021, some of the world's largest energy and technology companies are jockeying for position in a green hydrogen value chain that some see as a multitrillion-dollar opportunity.

For each of the three ESG dimensions (environmental, social, and governance), we first define the ESG credit risk factors, which are the factors that influence the capacity and willingness of an obligor to meet its financial commitments and that can have negative or positive credit impacts. We then provide guidance on how to assess and integrate these factors into the credit assessment.

Broad risk assessment factors can be captured in a model or scoring framework to support a consistent analysis across diverse projects. S&P Global Market Intelligence’s Project Finance suite of tools provides a framework for the analysis of Project Finance transactions, reflecting industry or sector and geographic-specific factors, with the use of well-established project finance debt rating criteria.

New York — Diversified natural resources major Glencore has entered a global agreement with satellite technology company Tre-Altamira to expand monitoring to over 110 of its tailings dams worldwide, marking the largest industry monitoring agreement to date, specifically focused on Tailings Storage Monitoring.

The speakers at the event, titled “Essential ESG: Incorporating ESG Scores into Corporate Strategies and Investor Communication,” featured Susan Beverly, senior director of sustainability and shared impact at the multinational healthcare company Abbott; Michael Dickstein, group sustainability director at the beverage firm Coca-Cola HBC; and Manijt Jus, managing director and global head of ESG Research & Data at S&P Global.

A group of 38 U.S. attorneys general filed a lawsuit on Dec. 17 against Alphabet Inc.'s Google, alleging the company engaged in anticompetitive conduct to maintain monopoly power in specific search and advertising markets. The suit claims that the search giant used revenue-sharing agreements with device makers like Apple and mobile providers like T-Mobile to maintain a virtual monopoly on search in the U.S.

As we reported in the previous PEMS issue, PE industry has shifted its view of ESG factors to a means through which it can add value, rather than simply a way to mitigate risk. [8] In the survey we explored this topic further by asking participants to define their core ESG strategy going into 2020.

Global markets have rallied to record highs on the news of successful vaccine development and deployments. The stability of this positive momentum is dependent on the viability of the vaccine, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

“With an average fiscal multiplier, the U.S. economy reaches its pre-pandemic GDP level by third-quarter 2021 in a $1 trillion stimulus scenario and by second-quarter 2021 with $1.5 trillion; without stimulus, GDP does not reach pre-pandemic levels until 2022 at earliest,” Beth Ann Bovino, Chief U.S. Economist at S&P Global Economics, said in a report earlier this month analyzing outcomes of three potential stimulus packages.

Since S&P Dow Jones Indices announced that Tesla would be added to the S&P 500® on Dec. 21, 2020, many investors have contacted us asking when this transformative company will become a member of the S&P 500 ESG Index, the sustainable counterpart to the S&P 500. The answer, in brief, is that Tesla will not automatically join the S&P 500 ESG Index upon its addition to the S&P 500.

The answer, in brief, is that Tesla will not automatically join the S&P 500 ESG Index upon its addition to the S&P 500.

The performance of ESG indices over the course of 2020 may point to an answer. At the beginning of the year, before the novel coronavirus became widespread and restrictions on activity became commonplace, the performance of the S&P 500 ESG Index largely tracked that of the S&P 500 Index upon which it is based.

The COVID-19 pandemic created a cascading series of cataclysms, beginning in March, for oil markets. Economic shutdowns led to the sharpest plunge in global oil demand on record as the coronavirus containment measures constricted mobility.

Months after the November U.S. presidential election and just two weeks away from his transition out of power, U.S. President Donald Trump is pressuring members of his party to overturn the result of the race that was won by Joe Biden, while the country remains paralyzed by the pandemic with a slow vaccine rollout. Across the world, one in every 50 Britons, or 1 million people across the U.K., are currently infected with the coronavirus, according to Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

Thousands of supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., yesterday—forcing legislators gathered for the formal certification of President-elect Joe Biden's victory to adjourn. Lawmakers including Vice President Mike Pence, alongside Congressional leaders and staffers, were evacuated and placed on lockdown as rioters breached the Capitol complex, chamber floors, and legislative offices.

While the S&P 500’s Energy sector suffered sharp losses in 2020—declining 37.3% largely due to the prolonged implications of April’s oil price crash, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence—the tide turned toward year-end. Energy stocks outperformed the broader market in the fourth quarter, with the S&P 500 Energy Index up 27.8% compared to the S&P 500 gains of 12.1%.

The pandemic disrupted nearly everything in 2020, and it brought a heightened focus on human capital management issues like employee safety. COVID-19 will be "a major theme of the coming year" in shareholder proposals, says Courteney Keatinge, a senior director of ESG research at Glass Lewis, which provides research and recommendations on how investor clients should vote on proposals from management and shareholders.

Our view of the sector remains negative given the level of pressures brought by COVID-19 and the recession. While we expect most credits will experience only slight, if any, deterioration in 2021 and beyond, in the current environment we still expect downgrades to outpace upgrades.

Negative now, but potentially back on track at some point in 2021. Although signs of a recovery have begun to take hold with the approval of vaccines and the stabilizing of certain revenues, many headwinds will continue to bear down on state credit stability in 2021.

The companies’ decisions may ignite stronger calls for regulation. In the U.S., some analysts believe bipartisan support for Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act may increase.

The global equities market experienced unprecedented fast drawdown and recovery in 2020. Although the S&P ESG Global Macro Index’s performance was not as stunning as that of the S&P 500® in 2020, it outperformed a pure equity and static 60% equity/40% bond portfolio with a risk control mechanism.1 This blog reviews how the S&P ESG Global Macro Index’s dynamic asset allocation helped to achieve this outcome.

As part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, Republicans legalized the selling of drilling leases in the refuge, which is one of America’s most sprawling and biodiverse landscapes, believing that it would bring in at least $1 billion over at least two sales by 2024. However, the first auction, on Jan. 6, of roughly 1 million acres brought in just $14.4 million in bids through a single buyer: the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, a development corporation owned by the state of Alaska.

Local governments may need to plug a budget gap. We begin 2021 with 11 of our state ratings carrying a negative outlook.

Because of electricity's essentiality, we believe the financial performance and ratings of only a subset of the public power and electric cooperative sector is vulnerable to the pandemic's economic pressures. We view the ratings of public power and electric cooperative utilities to be most vulnerable among those utilities whose electricity sales are sensitive to social distancing and travel restrictions, which our rating actions reflected when we assigned a negative outlook to California's Anaheim Public Utilities and lowered the rating and assigned a negative outlook to Florida's Reedy Creek Improvement District.

Each year, over 3,500 of the world’s most valuable2 publicly traded companies are invited to be part of the CSA survey. Of these, the largest 2,500 global companies by market capitalization are eligible for inclusion in the flagship Dow Jones Sustainability™ World Index (DJSI World), and are selected for inclusion if their S&P Global ESG score puts them among the top 10% in their industry.

Timing of statements on social unrest remains a delicate dance for CEOs. Several business leaders spoke out even before the Jan. 6 riots occurred.

The CSA will form the foundation of S&P Global’s ESG research across its different divisions (S&P Dow Jones Indices, S&P Global Ratings, S&P Market Intelligence). The ESG methodology committee formed by representatives of S&P Global and RobecoSAM, will ensure consistency in the ESG vision and make sure that the CSA continues to address ESG with a focus on financially material criteria and that the resulting scores meet the requirements for a broad range of investment applications.

We believe that some sovereigns in the core Islamic finance countries will tap the sukuk market more aggressively in 2021. We also foresee an increase in issuance by corporates.

Payment providers in the U.S. including PayPal, Venmo, Square, Visa, and Mastercard let their users conduct transactions with cryptocurrencies and have signaled that they want to expand such capabilities. In particular, PayPal, Visa, and Mastercard are eager to assert themselves as key players in the move toward crypto- and digital currencies, said Jordan McKee, research director at 451 Research, a division of S&P Global Market Intelligence.

And we look at how State Street Global Advisors Inc., one of the world's largest asset managers, is renewing its call for enhanced disclosure around race in 2021. The firm is also focused on the systemic risks associated with climate change — following a year in which the U.S. experienced record-breaking extreme weather and climate change-linked disasters.

A lack of clarity in the updated guidance over how U.S. companies should address investments sparked a sell-off of Chinese assets across Wall Street. In turn, buyers from around the world scooped up the discarded shares.

Traditionally, under corporate law, the fiduciary duty of a corporation is to act in the best interest of its shareholders, rather than serving its own interests. Loyalty and prudence are recognized as the most important duties, ensuring that fiduciaries act in good faith, avoiding conflicts of interest, and acting with due diligence.

As a percentage of total ESG and non-ESG rating actions over April-November, ESG-related actions accounted for as much as three-quarters of actions on sovereign/international public finance entities and one-third of U.S. public finance actions. For corporate and infrastructure entities, ESG factors contributed to one in three rating actions; bear in mind that we only treat COVID-19 as an ESG factor if it has direct health and safety effects on an entity's activities, not as a result of the economic crisis.

Of potential executive orders that the most powerful economy in the world’s new leader could soon implement, “the low-hanging fruit for a Biden presidency would include temporary protected status for all immigrants arriving from COVID-infected countries, shutting down oil and gas leasing on federal lands, redefining poverty levels, and so forth," John Owens, a professor of U.S. government and politics at the University of Westminster, told S&P Global Market Intelligence. “Over the slightly longer term, rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement, appointing a majority to the National Labor Relations Board, forgiving student loans, closing Guantanamo, reworking farm and food policy, lowering the cost of drugs and licensing generic drug manufacturing, [and] providing a public option for financial services,” among other future executive orders.

As ESG investing continues its rapid expansion, stakeholders’ desires for more comprehensive data will grow. Companies’ commitments to sustainability and diversity will require tangible data on how they are delivering real-world impacts.

President Trump’s future awaits him in the Senate. A two-thirds majority will be required from the upper chamber to convict him.

Because President-elect Biden won the U.S. presidency and the democrats have control of the U.S House of Representatives and Senate, we expect Congress will more likely implement a higher corporate tax rate. While details of such a plan are limited, a key element of the proposal would likely call for an increase in the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%.

In the first blog of this series, we discussed how environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors are gaining prominence within investment and risk management groups as more evidence shows that ESG factors can affect credit risk[1] and investment performance. [2] In this blog, we look specifically at the ‘G’ component, and describe how S&P Global Market Intelligence incorporates this in an analysis of credit risk, when using proprietary Credit Assessment Scorecards.

Financing conditions in emerging markets are also supportive. “Favorable vaccine developments, the expectation of a solid recovery in 2021, and accommodative monetary conditions in developed markets have boosted capital flows to EMs.

"While details of such a plan are limited, a key element of the proposal would likely call for an increase in the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%," the report states. "We estimate that this higher tax rate would improve the industry's [ratio of] funds from operations to debt by about 100 basis points.

French banks may face higher credit risk upon the expiration of moratoriums on loan repayments, a COVID-19 measure to protect borrowers. As of June 2020, French, Spanish, and Italian banks reported the highest volumes of loans subject to moratoriums among European banks.

The COVID-19 pandemic is an existential stress test that mercilessly reveals companies’ strengths and weaknesses. As ESG has been lifted to the top of corporate, investor and policy agendas in recent years, more investors may have understood that ESG analysis can identify sources of company resilience that go undetected in traditional financial analysis, showing which companies are better prepared for future risks and fat tail events.

The sustainability world has grappled for years with how to feed the growing appetite for ESG disclosure among investors, rating agencies and other stakeholders. Critics of the sustainability movement contend the lack of definition around ESG leaves room for green-washing.

Faced with a choice of over 600 ESG ratings globally, companies need clear yardsticks to select the best tool to inform their sustainability strategy and communicate their sustainability performance and progress to investors and other stakeholders. SustainAbility’s widely recognized “Rate the Raters” report is such a yardstick.

One of the key perspectives in explaining equal weight indices’ returns is their smaller size exposure: for example, over 50% of the historical variation in the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index’s relative returns is explained by size. This exposure occurs because, as Exhibit 3 illustrates, the distribution of weights within equal weight indices is far more even than within their market-cap weighted parents.

On Monday, shares in videogame retailer GameStop Corp. closed up 18% after investors encouraged one another on the chatroom platform Reddit to short the stock—pushing it up as high as 145% at one point in the day, in what analysts concluded is a continuing “short squeeze.” This occurs when short sellers who bet on a stock they believe will decline scramble to cover their positions when it instead rises, which in turn pushes the stock even higher. The humungous market swing followed similar activity on Friday, when individual investors communicating on the popular “WallStreetBets” Reddit thread also pushed GameStop’s shares higher in an effort to curtail the short-seller Citron Research, which declared on Jan. 22 that the company was “pretty much in terminal decline” and bet against it.

Duke Energy Corp. on Jan. 25 announced it has agreed to forgo recovery of about $1.1 billion in coal ash management costs as part of a settlement agreement reached in the North Carolina electric rate cases for Duke Energy Carolinas LLC, and Duke Energy Progress LLC. As a result, the utilities are each expected to incur a pretax charge to earnings of about $500 million in the fourth quarter of 2020.

What’s the material impact of the ESG data and scores on index construction and risk/return? Join S&P DJI’s Jaspreet Duhra, UBS Asset Management’s Andrew Walsh, and S&P Global’s Manjit Jus as they discuss the increasingly important role of market-leading ESG assessments.

Despite the coronavirus pandemic’s effect on the global economy and limitations on people’s ability to travel, global EV adoption expanded in 2020. Global EV sales skyrocketed 43% to total 3.24 million vehicles sold, according to the Swedish consultancy EV Volumes.

Asset managers such as State Street Global Advisors are advocating for companies to disclose nonfinancial racial diversity data, going so far as to describe racial inequity as “a systemic risk.” Firms around the world that implemented policies to increase their workforce diversity have ramped up their efforts as the public demands that companies take greater action as the pandemic puts pressure on the global economy. Investment banks including Goldman Sachs and stock exchanges like Nasdaq are beginning to push companies they fund or list to diversify their boards and management teams.

LIBOR transition risk: The phaseout date for most U.S. dollar LIBOR maturities has been extended by 18 months to June 2023. As of this writing, the December 2021 deadline for the four non-U.S. dollar LIBOR currencies remains intact.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) now projects the global economy to expand 5.5% this year and 4.2% next year due to "additional policy support in a few large economies and expectations of a vaccine-powered strengthening of activity later in the year, which outweigh the drag on near-term momentum due to rising infections." In its updated outlook on Jan. 26, the organization projected that the U.S. economy will grow 5.1%, the euro area 4.2%, and China 8.1% this year.

The COVID-19 pandemic has boosted demand for many cloud and IT services. This has, in turn, led to increased demand for leased datacenter space from cloud and IT service providers, as cloud providers' need for infrastructure has grown faster than expected and faster than they can build datacenters themselves.

Financial institutions are looking to dig deeper on a range of ESG factors that are expected to have an impact on a company’s growth, profitability, capital efficiency, and risk exposure. Many are taking steps to prepare for expected new regulations regarding ESG disclosure.

Midstream energy: We revised the overall industry risk score to intermediate (3) from low (2) because of increasing environmental risks posed by climate change and GHG emissions as well as the threat these risks pose to the future production and use of hydrocarbons over the long term. Contributing to this change was our reassessment of "secular change and substitution risk" to medium to reflect the increased risk that higher renewable penetration and the gradual pace of the energy transition could pressure the midstream industry over time.

GM’s targets come just one day after Japanese carmaker Nissan announced its plans for all new models in Japan, China, Europe, and the U.S. to be hybrid or fully electric vehicles by 2030. In the same week, U.S. President Joe Biden issued several broad executive orders that center climate change across varying policy areas, and BlackRock’s Larry Fink, the chief executive officer and chairman of the world’s largest asset manager, urged corporate executives to begin planning for a “net-zero” world.

Indices that integrate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) data are moving from the margins to the mainstream, as investors increasingly seek to align their values with their investments. A new type of ESG index is emerging to facilitate this change in Brazil: the S&P/B3 Brazil ESG Index.

What does “Backward Data Assumption” mean with respect to ESG data? Typically, when S&P DJI creates back-tested index data, we use data from relevant databases, or actual live data.

What are the regulations, and what do they aim to achieve? The EU Low Carbon Benchmark Regulation amends the EU Benchmark Regulation in two ways: first, it introduces two new benchmark classifications—EU Climate Transition Benchmarks (EU CTB) and EU Paris-Aligned Benchmarks (EU PAB)—and second, it requires administrators of ESG benchmarks to publish certain information.

How does S&P DJI intend to meet the new EU ESG disclosure requirements? S&P DJI has two benchmark administrators under the EU Benchmark Regulation (EU BMR): S&P DJI Netherlands B.V. (S&P DJI BV), an EU benchmark administrator based in Amsterdam and authorized by the Dutch Authority for Financial Markets; and S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC (S&P DJI), a corporation based in New York.

What are the S&P DJI ESG Scores? S&P DJI ESG Scores are environmental, social, and governance scores that robustly measure ESG risk and performance factors for corporations, with a focus on financial materiality.

Indices that integrate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) data are moving from the margins to the mainstream, as investors increasingly seek to align their values with their investments. A new type of ESG index is emerging to facilitate this change in Mexico: the S&P/BMV Total Mexico ESG Index.

The pandemic has proven a time to shine for mandates that invest with ESG principles in mind. Fueled by an accelerated appetite for sustainable funds in Asia, Morningstar data for the third quarter of 2020, for example, showed a record high $8.7 billion of net inflows.

And beyond sustainability-oriented issuance, an emphasis on entities' overall ESG credentials will grow. With the long overdue mainstreaming of ESG in investment decision-making, concerns abound about "good washing" or "green washing" or even "purpose-washing": with a flood of issuers attempting to best position themselves in front of an increasingly ESG-savvy group of investors, there's understandable apprehension.

With record low interest rates, pension plan sponsors are likely to turn to pension obligation bonds (POBs) for a variety of reasons other than financing pension benefits through debt issuance. POBs may be used to smooth increasing payments or alter the length of the payment schedule and possibly defer costs to future years (For more information, see "Pension Brief: POBs See Increasing Activity in Low-Interest-Rate Environment," Oct. 14, 2020).

"A key plank of our Build Back Better Recovery Plan is building a modern, resilient climate infrastructure and clean energy future that will create millions of good-paying union jobs — not $7, $8, $10, $12 an hour, but prevailing wage and benefits," said Biden. He said millions of Americans can have jobs working on modernizing water systems, transportation, and energy infrastructure to withstand the impacts of climate change.

Asset managers face such credit-related ESG risks directly through their own operations, such as treating their customers fairly, ensuring proper governance and transparency, and enabling equality in treatment of their workforce. However, the sources of ESG risks through investments may be more material for the entity's credit quality.

Christyan Malek, JP Morgan's head of oil and gas spoke to S&P Global Platts associate editorial director, Paul Hickin, about oil price risk, the evolution of the US shale sector, and the outcomes of Saudi Arabia's strategy to balance the global oil market.

On the subject of what the mining sector is doing to comply with increasing ESG mandates from investors, Fiona Reynolds, CEO of ESG body PRI said that market engagement had been “mixed” and the business still had some way to go. She said that from her experience it is investors who are driving natural resource companies to change their practices.

Consider, for example, our basic finding that, although ICE Indices' three ESG-related high-yield indexes outperformed the ICE BofA US High Yield Index during the severe downturn of March 2020, that edge arose from a side-effect of the ESG-based index selection process. Removing bonds with poor ESG scores raised the remaining universe's average rating and lowered its concentration in Energy.

We noted earlier that as a side effect of excluding bonds of ESG bad actors, the three high-yield ESG indexes diverge from the All HY in ratings mix and term risk. For the duration-matched ESG tilt and best-in-class indexes, these effects are partially reduced by reweighting the retained issues with an eye toward matching certain characteristics of the parent, all-high-yield index, to the extent feasible.

We worked at two levels in attempting to identify a residual ESG-related effect in the ESG-based indexes' March returns. The first involved the issue selection process of the ESG Tilt and Duration-Matched ESG Tilt indexes.

Clearly, the comparative returns of the ESG ETF and the ALL HY ETF were affected by a lot more than the portfolio profiles shown in the table just above. For instance, the ESG ETF should have been disadvantaged by its lower Energy concentration in May 2020, when the ICE BofA US High Yield Energy Index walloped the ICE BofA US High Yield Index, 12.73% to 4.57%.

Robinhood and other major brokerages including TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, and Interactive Brokers Group, who placed restrictions on meme stocks said that they did so to manage their own risks and protect their firms from financial losses alongside curtailing market volatility. "We have a huge concern over the financial viability of the intermediaries," like the smaller brokers and clearinghouses, Interactive Brokers Chairman Thomas Peterffy told S&P Global Market Intelligence.

Repsol’s ESG Evaluation of 68 reflects S&P Global Ratings' view of the company’s strong preparedness and relatively good management of its environmental and social risks in a highly exposed industry. While it remains inherently exposed to greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, pollution, water use, and contamination risks, we believe the company’s sustainability strategy is among the most advanced in the O&G sector.

Our key sustainability factors identify the most material environmental and social risks assessed in our ESG Evaluation. We assess the materiality of those risks across the industry’s value chain and reflect them in the weighting of our environmental and social factors.

Our ESG Evaluation score of 83 on ING mainly reflects our belief that the bank is among the strongest players in the banking industry in terms of its ability to leverage its role as financier to influence society's transition to a more sustainable and low-carbon economy. The breadth and depth of ESG integration allows the bank to manage ESG risks and opportunities along the entire value chain.

In a recent webinar I moderated, Brie Williams of State Street Global Advisors joined me to discuss how environmental, social, and governance (ESG) data and investing are now at an important turning point. We ran out of time to answer all the questions we received, and this post follows “Why Now for ESG?” and answers two questions about how conversations on ESG can change and add value for an advisory or wealth management firm and to its clients.

In 2020, the 21st rebalancing of the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSJ) occurred; however, this is the first time it has taken place solely under the umbrella of S&P Global (after S&P Global’s acquisition of RobecoSAM’s ESG Ratings business in January 2020). It also marked a new step forward toward greater transparency and insight, as S&P Global announced to companies that they would be receiving a new level of granularity in their results—scores on up to 120 individual questions and metrics in the Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA).

It appears that environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing is “all the rage”—not only in the Asia Pacific region but all around the world. At S&P DJI, we have spent a lot of time and effort thinking through how best to construct indices that consider ESG values.

I define core ESG indexing as the use of indices designed to apply environmental, social, and governance (ESG) screening and ESG scores to recognized and sometimes iconic indices like the S&P 500®, S&P/ASX 200, or S&P/TSX Composite. These headline indices become actionable components of asset allocation when a fund or separately managed accounts (SMA) provider tracks the index.

In a recent webinar I moderated, Brie Williams of State Street Global Advisors joined me to discuss how environmental, social, and governance (ESG) data and investing are now at an important turning point. During that webinar, we answered some advisor questions.

Chinese "mega banks" also finance both the domestic coal and foreign coal industries, while new coal power plants, mines and infrastructure are still being built in non-OECD countries such as Turkey, India, Vietnam and Bangladesh, Kuiper said.

For a U.S. investor, developed market exposure outside of the U.S. is a core building block in forming a comprehensive global portfolio. In part because of its status as the world’s first international equity index, MSCI EAFE enjoys a commanding market presence for international equity benchmarks.

The COVID-19 pandemic is an existential stress test that mercilessly reveals companies’ strengths and weaknesses. As ESG has been lifted to the top of corporate, investor and policy agendas in recent years, more investors may have understood that ESG analysis can identify sources of company resilience that go undetected in traditional financial analysis, showing which companies are better prepared for future risks and fat tail events.

"Environmental issues are the biggest risk among ESG factors to avoid in pursuing a deal," Rokuro Hara, CEO at J-STAR Co. Ltd., a Japanese private equity firm, told S&P Global Market Intelligence. "Investors want to entrust money to a manager [at PEs] that has developed an ESG policy," and integrating ESG into deal assessments helps "increase the value of our investment," he added.

Volumes of green bond issuance in the Middle East and North Africa have lagged behind other emerging markets in recent years, with China leading the way. But a confluence of political direction, international investor activity and measures taken by Gulf sovereign wealth funds is helping drive awareness around green bonds, green and sustainable financing and ESG more generally, said Darin Rovere, CEO at Sustainability Excellence, a consultancy based in Abu Dhabi.

On the latest episode of Fixed Income in 15, our host Joe Cass is joined by S&P Global’s President & CEO Doug Peterson and the Co-Founder of The Carlyle Group David Rubenstein. Doug and David discussed markets, diversity and the impact of ESG.

In the final countdown to the U.S. presidential election, President Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden remain deeply divided on climate change. Current and former negotiators in international climate talks say a Biden administration that rejoins the Paris climate accord and prioritizes fighting climate change could turn the tide in the effort to prevent the worst effects of global warming.

“The position of regional partners for Myanmar is only just emerging. Panjiva data shows China represented 33% of Myanmar's exports in 2019, while the EU represented 23.2%, Thailand 15.4%, Japan 7.4% and the U.S. 4.4%,” Chris Rodgers, a senior global supply chain research analyst at Panjiva, said in a report this week.

The DOL acknowledged in the final rule that certain ESG issues like climate change and poor corporate governance can create "an economic business risk or opportunity" to companies and their investors. However, like many ESG skeptics, the DOL raised concerns about whether an ERISA plan fiduciary could be swayed by the rising momentum behind ESG to pick investments that carry higher fees with worse returns, ultimately hurting beneficiaries.

Fewer than one in five mining leaders globally are women, according to a recent analysis by S&P Global Market Intelligence.

The profitability should not come as a shock, according to Darnell Hunt, UCLA dean of social sciences and professor of sociology and African American studies, who also was a co-author on the UCLA report. Rather, it should be surprising that the industry doubted that correlation for so long, given that in the U.S., Latino people go to the theater more than others, and Latino and Black populations consume more media in general, he said.

From an ESG perspective, the S&P/B3 Brazil ESG Index was able to improve its ESG score relative to that of the S&P Brazil BMI. During its most recent rebalance, the overall ESG score of the S&P/B3 Brazil ESG Index increased from 47.9 to 57.7, an improvement of 9.8 points; considering that the maximum attainable ESG score of any strategy using the S&P Brazil BMI is 95.9, the ESG realized potential was 20.4%.

S&P Global's ongoing transparency efforts to highlight ESG impacts on credit ratings align with investors' and issuers' increased focus on sustainability. For instance, with hydrocarbon producers we factor in that investors' and financial institutions' increasing adoption of ESG investment mandates also means market access may gradually become more challenging and costly for the former.

Among the industry's biggest players, Rio Tinto, Vale, BHP and Anglo American have blazed the trail with driverless iron ore trains in the Pilbara, a truckless conveyor-belt ore transport system in Carajas, electric vehicles in the Olympic Dam underground copper mine and "FutureSmart" intelligent mine initiatives in South Africa, but at considerable expense. Medium-size mine operations will need to follow to be able to compete: so far only one mine, Resolute Mining's Syama underground gold mine in Mali, using Sandvik equipment, is reportedly fully-automated from extraction to haulage of the mined product, although human intervention is still required for pre-setting of where to blast.

Despite the World Health Organization’s recommendation this week that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine should be administered worldwide regardless of the prevalence of COVID-19 mutations, South Africa halted its distribution.

The embrace of ambitious carbon and coal-reduction targets is not ubiquitous throughout the cooperative sector. We believe that some utilities and their customers lack the financial wherewithal to support decarbonization undertakings or that the scope of such initiatives would be too great for the utility's size.

With these adjustments, the resulting 274 constituents of the S&P MidCap 400 ESG Index and 407 constituents of the S&P SmallCap 600 ESG Index manage to closely replicate the underlying risk/return profile of the respective benchmark (with welcome outperformance; see Exhibit 1)—as well as provide measurable ESG improvements (see Exhibits 2 and 3). This result, coupled with an almost identical underlying factor exposure to their benchmarks (even when it comes to size, surprisingly) confirms that these new ESG indices are poised to do precisely what they are intended to do (see Exhibits 4 and 5).

Mandatory and reliable data on companies' climate risks will be critical in that work, but "uncertainty about the future climate trajectory will remain" and require more safeguards at banks, she said. Bank supervisors should encourage lenders to ensure they would be resilient against a range of climate outcomes, and "new or enhanced supervisory tools" could help them do so.

“We expect the municipal sustainable debt market to grow in 2021, building on momentum and substantial growth in social and sustainability labeled bonds,” S&P Global Ratings said in a report this week. “We estimate municipal green-labeled debt issuance of about $18 billion and total municipal sustainable debt issuance potentially surpassing $30 billion.”

This is the third blog in a four-part series on ESG and Credit Risk Analysis In the first blog, we discussed how environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors are becoming important considerations when assessing the credit risk of different industries and companies around the world. We followed this with a second blog that took a closer look at the governance component, and how S&P Global Market Intelligence incorporates this in its proprietary Credit Assessment Scorecards (“Scorecards”).

Incorporating material environmental risk factors into credit analyses strives to evaluate how these factors can potentially impact the credit risk of the counterparty being reviewed. In doing so, it is important to recognize that many environmental risks are only likely to crystallize and affect an entity’s creditworthiness over a longer timeframe than the one to five years typically used in credit assessments.

Many investors and other stakeholders have been actively expressing the need for greater transparency on the ESG strategies of companies.

Post-Brexit Britain is looking to relax its rules surrounding SPACs to compete with Amsterdam’s financial industry.

Activity in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru was stronger than anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2020, spurred by continued resilience across manufacturing and commodities industries, and S&P Global Ratings expects a pickup in growth in the second quarter despite a slower start to this year. In addition, S&P Global Platts Analytics projects global oil demand will reach 102.6 million barrels per day by the fourth quarter—marking the highest level since the same period in 2019, when demand averaged 103.9 million barrels per day.

“Nobody could look back on 2020 and not see the implications of the pandemic, social inequities through the Black Lives Matter movement, the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on different minority groups, and the real climate issues that we see every day on the television,” Martina Cheung, president of S&P Global Market Intelligence and head of ESG for S&P Global, told the Essential Podcast. “What I would hope to see five years from now is that companies, sectors, and governments have made meaningful progress in actually incorporating all of this into planning and decision-making.

Martina Chung: The agenda around the climate that's been announced by the white house is very broad-reaching and comprehensive, and I think it takes into consideration a lot of the pieces that need to come together so that we can actually really move the needle around how the U.S. Is tackling climate risk and incentivizing the right activity to support resilience and transition. So, to me, signing up to the Paris accord again was clearly a massive first step.

Within Europe, companies in the U.K. experienced the highest number of campaigns and rating actions, a continuation of the trend over the past few years. This reflects the still depreciated value of the pound and the sophistication of the U.K. capital markets, along with investors' beliefs that Brexit has created an opportunity snap up underpriced assets.

The S&P 500® GARP (Growth at a Reasonable Price) Index just had its second anniversary since its launch in February 2019. During the latter half of this time, the world experienced the worst global pandemic in a century.

The LPCs have no TVA board representation. The TVA board members are appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the U.S. Senate.

Analysts believe that the world’s most-emitting economy could still change course. "China may pull out a wild card" with additional details on how it will shift to clean energy to achieve its net-zero target, potentially after President Xi meets with U.S. President Joe Biden next month, Yoshihiro Fujii, an executive of the Research Institute for Environmental Finance, told S&P Global Market Intelligence.

Our key sustainability factors identify the most material environmental and social risks assessed in our ESG Evaluation. We assess the materiality of those risks across the metals and mining value chain and reflect them in the weighting of our environmental and social factors.

Finally, the SPAC craze shows no sign of slowing. More U.S. blank-check companies listed in the first 70 days of 2021 than in the whole of 2020.

"Human capital, human rights, climate change — these issues are fundamental to our markets, and investors want to and can help drive sustainable solutions on these issues. We see that unmistakably in shifts in capital toward ESG investing, we see it in investor demands for disclosure on these issues, we see it increasingly reflected on corporate proxy ballots, and we see it in corporate recognition that consumers and investors alike are watching corporate responses to these issues more closely than ever," Lee said.

Some working in the U.S. coal sector were under the impression that the coal plant closures might stop under the pro-coal Trump administration. Slevin said that was a "false promise," and noted that coal consumption continued to decline.

Raiffeisen plans to expand its activity in wind and solar technologies. It aims to increase the share of Austrian corporate loans to environmental, social and governance-compliant investments to about 33% from 10% by 2025.

"I think of two of the bank franchises that have done tremendously in building shareholder value in my tenure — [SVB Financial Group] and [First Republic Bank] — both have been very focused on long-term values, very focused on their customers, very focused on their employees," Cannon said in the episode. "I think that's especially important today with the increased focus on ESG, which, as you know, there's more money flowing into ESG.

Before the COVID-19 crisis, telehealth was used episodically “as a quick fix to get a bridge to a particular issue. But the COVID pandemic has really redefined this.

In the U.S., investors are also increasingly calling on companies to disclose their climate plans. In December 2020, Exxon Mobil announced a five-year plan to cut emissions following a campaign by activist investors targeting the company for its failure to address the needs of the long-term energy transition.

Proposals to form a national clean electricity standard have become a central focus of climate change legislation in the new Congress as U.S. President Joe Biden pushes for a carbon-free power sector. The concept has support from Democrats and Republicans, with nearly 40 U.S. states already adopting renewable or clean energy goals or standards, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data.

While other refiners and oil companies are starting to embrace ESG, it has been a key part of Meridian Energy's strategy since 2013, when the company was formed.

U.K.-based uranium purchaser Yellow Cake PLC elected March 15 to fully exercise its $100 million uranium purchase option for 2021 with JSC National Atomic Co. Kazatomprom and agreed to purchase another 440,000 pounds from the Kazakh uranium major. The move may prompt Kazatomprom, which is the largest uranium producer in the world, to purchase material on the spot market to fulfill outstanding contracts.

Fred Cannon, former director of research and head of equity strategy at Stifel Financial Corp. unit Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc., offered his advice on the latest Street Talk podcast on how banks can best communicate with investors. Cannon recently decided to retire after a career on the Street.

Although COVID-19 remains the biggest threat to portfolios, North American PE/VC firms are largely optimistic going into 2021, with most expecting to see investment activity increase and a majority of firms focusing on new investments, especially in the Healthcare and IT sectors. North American firms are also beginning to catch up to their global peers when it comes to factoring in ESG, with a growing number of respondents now committed to addressing ESG factors in some capacity.

The investors behind a new net-zero report are pushing companies in the energy, metals and mining, chemicals, transportation and consumer sectors to assess and disclose their climate risks. They plan to use the report to help engage with companies and inform their votes on climate-related shareholder proposals at annual meetings.

While all ESG-related rating actions in 2020 were driven by social credit factors, primarily due to health and safety considerations related to the pandemic, rating actions at the beginning of 2021 reflect some exposure to environmental credit factors. Six out of 43 rating changes in February were linked to the recent revision in industry risk in the oil and gas sector, and three more were downgrades attributed to the environmental risk of coal ash.

Ever Given, a 224,000-ton mega container ship sailing under the Panama flag, was lodged sideways and ran aground in Egypt’s Suez Canal on March 24 after being swept up in a 40-knot sandstorm that caused a blackout which diminished visibility and navigation. The transportation chokepoint blocked by one of the shipping world’s most monumental vessels connects the Red Sea with the Mediterranean and serves as a primary waterway in the international trade of consumer goods and petroleum products between Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and the U.S.

SPACs are "creating more exit alternatives for private equity and other private capital investors around companies that fit in the energy transition broadly," George Bilicic, vice chairman and global head of Power, Energy and Infrastructure investment banking at the financial services firm Lazard, said during the S&P Global Market Intelligence Power and Gas M&A Symposium. "A positive dynamic of the SPAC phenomenon is it's assisting in the gathering of capital to support these energy transition companies and pulling forward or taking capital needs off the table, arguably, which facilitates the implementation of business plans including in some companies that are more binary risks from a technology perspective."

The banking sector is progressing faster than many companies they finance, as evidenced by the mismatch between the more than €4 trillion in capital that European banks have vowed to align with the Paris Agreement on climate change and the amount of suitable corporate lending available in the market in Europe, the CDP, formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project, said in a recent report. Banks, too, need better environmental, social and governance data from the market and to harmonize standards within the financial sector, industry observers said.

According to the analysis, published March 18, 45% of FTSE 100 companies currently have an ESG measure in either their annual bonus targets or their long-term incentive plans, also known as LTIP. Of the 100 companies, 37% include an ESG measure in their bonus plan with an average weighting of 15%, while 19% include them in their LTIP with an average weighting of 16%.

The health of the global economy is predicated on the health of the global community, and the outlook is bright for both. S&P Global Ratings now forecasts the Asia-Pacific economy to grow 7.3% this year; the U.S. to boom this year and next by 6.5% and 3.1%, respectively; the six largest Latin-American economies to swell a combined 4.9% this year, with the average economy in the region returning to pre-pandemic levels by mid-2022; and the eurozone economy to expand 4.2% in 2021 and 4.4% in 2022.

Education issuers accounted for the majority of social municipal debt issued last year. Notably, 10 municipal issuers, primarily in transportation and water sectors—the New York MTA, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Power Authority of the State of New York, Florida Development Finance Corporation, San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District, Illinois Finance Authority, San Francisco Public Utilities, San Diego County Water Authority, Los Angeles County Public Works Financing Authority, and Hastings Campus Housing Finance Authority—accounted for 65% of green-labeled debt issued last year.

While governance is a material factor for all companies, social risks, similar to environmental risks, are more material for some borrowers versus others, depending on the sector in which they operate, plus their location and level of diversification. Therefore, we have developed an ESG sector materiality map.

We explore the looming risks of water scarcity in the latest episode of S&PGlobal's "ESG Insider" podcast.We hear from Will Sarni, founder and CEO of water consultancy Water Foundry. Will says the world struggles to value water, which makes it difficult to secure capital investments in water technologies and solutions.

Although the White House will still need to collaborate with Congress to draft the comprehensive legislation, the American Jobs Plan could transform the U.S. energy landscape if it can survive Republican opposition (and perhaps reluctance from some Democrats) alongside pushback from the oil and gas industry. Its provisions call for creating a federal energy-efficiency and clean- electricity standard, manufacturing electric vehicles and advancing charging infrastructure, and plugging abandoned oil and gas wells and reclaiming old coal, hard rock, and uranium mines across the nation, among others.

While 2020 was an exceptional year for U.S. corporate bankruptcies, a larger share of distressed companies upended by the COVID-19 pandemic is using court processes to restructure instead of close shop. Nearly 62% of U.S. corporate bankruptcy filings in 2020 sought reorganizations, the highest rate for any year going back to at least 2010, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data.

We are maintaining our price assumptions for nickel because new technology for producing nickel sulfate, an important ingredient in the production of lithium-ion batteries, from low-grade nickel pig iron (NPI) could materially expand the resource base for the battery sector, which is one of the key drivers of nickel prices recently, thereby easing the upward pressure on prices. Until now, companies produced nickel sulfate from high-grade nickel (about 40% of primary nickel supply in 2020) while cheaper low-grade nickel, such as NPI (about 45% of primary nickel supply in 2020), was primarily used in the production of stainless steel.

The most selected reason for subscribing to TVision instead of another virtual multichannel service was “price for what you get” at 19%, among subscribers surveyed in Kagan’s February 2021 MediaCensus online consumer survey. However, with three tiered packages at incremental price points, TVision was not a budget service like Philo, which pitted the service head-to-head with more established services.

We placed nine oil and gas issuers on CreditWatch with negative implications in January after we revised our risk assessment for the oil and gas integrated, exploration, and production industry to moderately high risk from intermediate risk. Subsequently, the tally of oil and gas issuers we placed on CreditWatch with negative implications rose to 10 in January.

March was a momentous month for the market. Imports of LNG, which is used for industrial heating and to fuel heavy-duty transport, climbed 5.8% year-over-year last month, marking the biggest increase in the 12-month period since March 2020, according to Bloomberg.

European banks may gain an edge over their U.S. peers with a proposed "green asset ratio" designed to give investors clarity on increasingly important environmental issues, according to market participants. The European Banking Authority has recommended that banks adopt a greet asset ratio, or GAR, to show how their economic activities are environmentally sustainable, putting the proposal out to consultation.

Integrating ESG into Sovereign Bond Portfolios SUMMARY
 Market-value-weighted portfolios give more weight to riskier issuers, e.g., those that issue more debt.  Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) weighting is an alternative way to construct a portfolio that looks at the sustainability of a country with a view focused on the long term.

The weights of Greece, Spain, and Italy have consistently been lower in the S&P ESG Pan-Europe Developed Sovereign Bond Index than in the S&P Pan-Europe Developed Sovereign Bond Index. Greece’s weight was actually brought close to zero far before the country’s problems surfaced.

We have also gone beyond the EU Low Carbon Benchmark requirements by aligning with the recommendations of the TCFD (Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures). We believe that the TCFD approach of breaking climate issues into transition risks, physical risks, and opportunities provides a holistic assessment.

Notably, Hwan drew down some of the fund's double-digit stock holdings in semiconductor companies Micron Technology Inc. and Applied Materials Inc. — a part of the technology sector the fund had built up its stake in since late 2018 — and put that money toward diversifying the portfolio. Some of the companies Hwan added include Verizon Communications Inc., The Bank of New York Mellon Corp., financial technology company Intuit Inc., healthcare and pharmaceutical company Novartis AG, healthcare technology company Cerner Corp. and payroll processing and administration company Paychex Inc.

In 2020, 60 of the world's largest commercial and investment banks financed $750.73 billion to the fossil fuel industry, down from $823.68 billion in 2019, but above $709.23 billion in 2016. Investors and regulators have grown increasingly concerned about long-term climate risks, fearing that if industries like coal and gas become obsolete, financial institutions will be left with stranded assets.

“Over that 30 years, [the S&P GSCI has] really paved the way in terms of index innovation in the commodity market. Today, just as it was when it launched in April 1991, it's the most widely recognized commodity index benchmark.

Government mandates, incentives, and standards to lower the carbon intensity of fuel combined with consumer demands for meaningful action on climate change has accelerated the demand for renewable diesel feedstocks. Refiners can produce renewable diesel from animal fats, plant oils, and used cooking oil, but in North America renewable diesel producers will increasingly be relying on soybean and canola oil to run new plants.

This report is part of the S&P Global Platts Metals Trade Review series, where S&P Global Platts digs through datasets and digest some of the key trends in metallurgical coal, iron ore, scrap and alumina.

Hydrogen adoption is widely seen as essential in the transition away from dependence on fossil fuel energy generation and toward a renewable energy mix. While the majority of hydrogen currently in production is generated from petroleum, natural gas, and coal, low-carbon hydrogen is lauded by market participants for its usefulness and versatility across the energy value chain.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended pausing the use of Johnson & Johnson’s coronavirus vaccine across the country due to cases of rare blood clots in a few recipients. European countries will pivot to prioritizing the Pfizer vaccine after also halting the distribution of the J&J vaccine and stopping the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine due to a possible link between that jab and extraordinarily atypical blood clots that are sometimes fatal.

"The development of low-carbon LNG will contribute to meet the growth in global energy demand whilst reducing the carbon intensity of the energy products consumed," Breuillac said. "Reducing its carbon footprint is essential for LNG to play its role fully in the energy transition."

Global carbon emissions from energy generation plummeted more than 6% last year when activity screeched to a halt during lockdowns, marking the biggest decline ever recorded. The oil and gas industry became burdened with oversupply and tumbling demand, while wind, solar, and hydropower generation climbed 50% worldwide.

Shareholders filed hundreds of ESG-related shareholder proposals for the 2021 proxy season. In this episode of the "ESG Insider" podcast, we explore three emerging investor resolutions.

A Volkswagen spokesperson said the company has no evidence of forced labor in the supply chain of Volkswagen Group China or its subsidiaries, and that no outside organization "has any role or influence in hiring decisions." Late last year, however, the CEO of Volkswagen Group China, Stephan Wöllenstein, told German broadcaster Deutsche Welle that the company could not guarantee workers were not coming to the Xinjiang factory from detention camps.

In a wave of announcements in the first quarter of 2021, Sweden's SEB Investment Management AB said it will start blacklisting fossil-fuel assets across its investment funds, while Swedbank Robur AB will only invest in oil and gas companies that are on its "Green List." Nordea Asset Management has restricted the majority of its funds from holding oil and gas stocks that are not aligned with the Paris Agreement, and claims its wealth and asset management business will likely be "100% ESG" in five to 10 years.

When it comes to the specifics, we have both internal- and external-looking commitments. For example, Southern committed $200 million through 2025 to advance racial equity and social justice in our communities.

The emissions picture is also worrisome in Europe's power sector, where utilities are sending mixed messages as they tout expiration dates for natural gas while continuing to build new power plants that use the fuel. "Fossil gas is a fuel that will need to be scaled back at considerable speed as we pursue the transition to net-zero," said Frans Timmermans, the European Union's climate czar.

We partner closely with our regulators and, by and large, our plan is regulatory approved. We have a resource plan for the upper Midwest where we are asking the regulators to approve the shutdown of our final two coal plants.

Drummi Bhatt, Mitsubishi Power Americas: To operationalize the decarbonization vision, I think several kinds of renewable and short- and long-duration energy storage technologies are needed to work seamlessly together, and these are the technologies we have been exploring for years. On the short-duration energy storage side, Mitsubishi sells the lithium-ion battery storage systems that excel at affordably storing renewable power for up to four hours, which is very useful for moving power from the afternoon to the early evening, or for other short-term uses.

European utilities are already racing toward achieving net-zero emissions across their output. Nineteen of the 22 largest power and gas utilities on the continent have now set targets, according to an S&P Global Market Intelligence analysis.

Where does S&P DJI get its ESG data? S&P Global provides the data that powers the globally recognized Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI), S&P 500 ESG Index, and others in the S&P ESG Index Series.

The SPAC phenomenon is pushing value levels up to ones that are hard to support with traditional valuation analysis. It is creating more exit alternatives for private equity and other private capital investors around companies that fit in energy transition broadly.

The importance of energy security—defined by the International Energy Agency as “the uninterrupted availability of energy sources at an affordable price”—has intensified during the compounding global health, economic, and climate crises. In the short-term, energy security pertains to energy systems’ ability to respond to sudden changes in the supply-demand balance.

“Climate change and biodiversity loss are interlinked, but solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are unlikely to benefit biodiversity in the same way. Instead, biodiversity needs to be given equal consideration in any nature-based climate solution offering,” the S&P Global Ratings Sustainable Finance Scientific Council said in a recent report.

U.K.-based human rights group RAID accused The London Bullion Market Association of walking back on a pledge that it would suspend certifications for gold refineries suspected of violating its ethical sourcing standards, citing the gold trade group's report on responsible metals supplies stating that it would only do so "as a last resort." The association, or LBMA, is the world's largest gold exchange and has been seen by the corporate world as administering the best standard available to define gold and silver as acceptable for banks and manufacturers.

According to the LBMA's responsible gold guidance, if the result of gold supply due diligence conducted by the association indicates any violations or a high possibility thereof, the refinery should stop processing gold from the origin until it can obtain additional information to confirm or refute the preliminary assessment. The list of violations includes money laundering, terrorist financing, serious human rights abuses, direct or indirect support to illegitimate nonstate armed groups and a fraudulent misrepresentation of the origin of minerals.

Despite the global battle cry to build a more sustainable marketplace, the pandemic-prompted economic downturn has pushed some investors to reduce their focus on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors during this year of difficult market conditions.

“Certain investors saw the volatile markets resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic as a testing period for the new breed of ESG indices, like the S&P 500 ESG Index, which aim to provide a benchmark-like return. These indices did extraordinary well, not just performing in line with the market and achieving their objective, but also providing some welcome outperformance,” S&P Dow Jones Indices Head of ESG Indices Reid Steadman told the Daily Update.

Although the victor of the U.S. presidential election isn’t yet determined, as millions of ballots across the country will be counted in the coming days, the intense contest that has gripped the world wasn’t the referendum on the Trump Administration’s actions during the past three and a half years that Democrats had hoped for.

Since 1944, the outcome of the U.S. presidential election could be predicted with a high level of confidence by looking at the performance of the S&P 500 over the three months preceding polling day. If the S&P 500 rose from July 31 to Oct. 31, the party controlling the White House won the election 82% of the time, according to calculations by S&P Dow Jones Indices.

CEOs of some mid-sized U.S. pipeline companies said attracting new money to the midstream sector requires a bigger emphasis on environmental, social and governance issues as investors increasingly scrutinize energy companies' employee diversity and sustainability practices.

"Since midstream companies tend to favor reporting only Scope 1, this actually makes gas pipelines appear to be big emitters, and crude and [natural gas liquids] pipelines as negligible.

The strong and growing pressure on oil and gas companies to dramatically reconfigure their core businesses to accept a lower-carbon agenda could soon lead to irreversible changes in the energy commodity markets. .

Intensity-based targets measure the amount of emissions released into the atmosphere divided by net hydrocarbon production. A company could maintain or even increase oil and gas production and still hit its carbon intensity targets by adding low-carbon alternatives like solar and wind farms to its portfolio.

Telecom companies are exposed to material environmental risks across their value chain: --Transition to low-carbon energy sources: The rapid increase in data traffic across telecom networks raises electricity use at data centers and in network infrastructure.

Investments in key sustainability sectors could help to strengthen the pace of Latin America's economic recovery in a post-COVID-19 world, though the region needs to offer more ESG-qualifying assets to do so, experts say. Global funds that invest under ESG principals topped $1 trillion in assets under management amid the COVID-19 crisis, according to data compiled by Morningstar.

Internationally, green bond markets reached $258.9 billion in 2019; but less than 2% of those issuances were tied to Latin America, data from Climate Bond Initiative shows. Similarly, a Bank of America survey showed that just 0.5% of equity assets under management from Latin America foreign funds have an ESG focus; that compares to the 3% to 4% average seen in other parts of the world.

The collapse of the German digital payments company Wirecard seemingly illustrates Warren Buffett’s famous aphorism: “You never know who's swimming naked until the tide goes out.”
Wirecard, long the darling of the German fintech market, filed for insolvency this week due to what it described as “excessive indebtedness.” Reports indicate that the approximately €1.9 billion ($2.1 billion) the company claimed to have on their books has either gone missing or never existed. Longtime Wirecard auditor EY indicated in a statement that there were “clear indications that this was an elaborate and sophisticated fraud, involving multiple parties around the world in different institutions, with a deliberate aim of deception.” Reports dating back years, in the Financial Times and other new outlets, have suggested that Wirecard’s challenges may be unique to a company that has struggled with balance-sheet irregularities for more than a decade.

After a rapid and severe flight of capital from Latin American markets earlier in the year, some countries are seeing renewed interest by way of sovereign bond issuances, despite a worsening economic outlook for the region. Heading into 2020, sovereign issuances across Latin America were widely expected to grow over the course of the year amid stronger growth projections and easing central bank policies.

Dominion Energy Inc. pointed to the growing importance of environmental, social and governance practices as one of the "key considerations" in weighing the sale of its midstream gas assets and narrowing its focus on cleaner energy resources.

"[O]ur climate goals remain intact and ... natural gas remains an essential part of our company's clean energy strategy and our path to net zero emissions," Duke Energy spokesperson Neil Nissan said in a July 6 email. "Without the [Atlantic Coast Pipeline], we're planning to invest in renewables, battery storage, energy efficiency programs and grid projects.

After experiencing its shortest bear market in history, on Aug. 18 the S&P 500 benchmark index closed up 0.11% from its previous peak six months ago—rallying more than 50% to erase the pandemic-prompted losses and marking a new historic high. Under the current conditions, the latest market record comes as a surprise when juxtaposed with the widespread loss of life and unemployment spurred by the pandemic.

S&P Global Ratings' view on the U.S. not-for-profit higher education sector has been negative for three years, and the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic impacts exacerbate financial pressures colleges and universities were already facing. Measures to contain the pandemic caused most colleges and universities to substantially reduce on-campus activities and send students home in the spring, resulting in a loss of auxiliary revenues and a move to online learning.

Wall Street is anticipating a victory for U.S. presidential candidate Joe Biden and a “blue wave” of Democratic wins in the House and Senate elections, despite the idea that such an outcome could result in a perceived negative for business: an increase in the U.S. corporate tax rate.

Mr. Biden’s platform favors raising the corporate tax rate to 28%. He additionally has proposed implementing a 15% minimum tax on the profits reported to shareholders of companies with a net income greater than $100 million; applying a 10% offshoring tax penalty on U.S. companies' overseas profits earned on sales back to the U.S. and raising the tax rate on those profits to 30.8%; as well as granting a 10% advanceable tax credit for companies that make investments to create jobs for American workers and accelerate the economic recovery from the pandemic-prompted downturn.

INTRODUCTION
The S&P Global Carbon Efficient Index Series is designed to reduce carbon exposure while maintaining similar levels of risk/return to the benchmark. Most notably, the index series incentivizes behavioral change among companies by uniquely encouraging two things:
Greater corporate transparency by rewarding companies that disclose greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions with a 10% boost in index weight; and
The diversification of company business models toward lowcarbon alternatives as companies seek to improve their standing in the index.

The S&P Global Carbon Efficient Index Series is designed to measure financial markets worldwide and offers market participants the opportunity to reduce their exposure to carbon risk. The methodology is also sector neutral, amounting to a carbon reduction of 20%-60% relative to the underlying benchmarks, with low tracking errors and comparable returns, thereby demonstrating that there need not be an inherent trade-off between investment performance and decarbonization.

As the U.S. pressures the Chinese technology companies ByteDance, WeChat, and Huawei, trade talks between Washington and Beijing are at a standstill—putting their phase-one trade agreement on ice. “I don’t want to talk to China right now,” U.S. President Donald Trump said in Arizona on Tuesday after indefinitely postponing the negotiations over the weekend, according to Bloomberg.

China's July data show private demand remains soft, the recovery is still unbalanced, and core inflation is falling. Optimism about the recovery and a change in tone from policymakers had ushered in expectations of tighter monetary policies, and real interest rates have risen.

The S&P 500 ESG Index achieved a 21.17% boost in its aggregate S&P DJI ESG Score performance compared with the S&P 500—with numerous positive impacts pertaining to issues like female representation in management positions, greenhouse gas emission reduction targets, effective risk culture, and many more. The S&P 500 ESG Index achieved these impacts with 83 bps of tracking error over the past five years and excess returns of 0.53% over the same period.

One day after the U.S. election, President Donald Trump’s directive for the U.S. to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change—under which nearly 200 nations joined together to limit global warming to no greater than 2 degrees Celsius by 2100—officially went into effect.

The global oil and gas industries have weathered a brutal blow from the coronavirus crisis’ damping of demand and an equally sharp slashing of supply. Due to the global economy contracting and consumer behaviors dramatically changing, long-term oil demand has shrunk by 2.5 million barrels per day, with full-year demand to erase the six proceeding years of growth by declining 8.1 million barrels per day, according to S&P Global Platts Analytics’ Future Energy Outlooks.

Harvard University professor Meghan O'Sullivan shares what she sees as the top geopolitical themes likely to persist beyond the pandemic.

he launch of the S&P 500 ESG Index in April 2019 signaled an evolution in sustainable investing. Indices based on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) data were no longer simply a means for companies to declare their sustainability credentials or tools to manage tactical investments playing a minor role in investors’ portfolios.

The S&P 500 ESG Index addressed the need for an index that incorporates ESG values while offering benchmark-like performance. Intentionally broad—including over 300 of the original S&P 500 companies—the S&P 500 ESG Index reflects many of the attributes of the S&P 500 itself, while providing an improved sustainability profile.

"Companies are responding to the public shame and making changes," Illinois State Representative Chris Welch said, explaining how the 2019 state law he sponsored requiring companies to report on their race metrics will be effective in increasing board diversity. "Public shaming works."

Welch is one of two state legislators we interviewed for the latest episode of ESG Insider, an S&P Global podcast about environmental, social and governance issues. The episode examines how corporate diversity laws enacted in Illinois in 2019 and in California in September 2020 aim to make publicly traded companies embrace racial diversity on their boards.

Facing mounting credit exposure from struggling small businesses and consumers, surging defaults, and ongoing interest rates at or near zero, European banks may soon face their largest hurdle. Loan losses loom as the pandemic persists.

Still, Europe’s 20 largest banks’ provisions don’t compare to those of the eight largest U.S. banks, which reserved $41.5 billion for loan losses in the second quarter, according to the Bloomberg analysis. U.S. banks have more capital and liquidity than their European counterparts in both business-as-usual and crisis scenarios, but are currently conducting business in the country hardest-hit by the pandemic.

Across the board, pure-play shale gas producers are increasingly talking about environmental, social and governance issues in analyst and investor calls, according to an S&P Global Market Intelligence analysis of company call transcripts. Shale gas producers are under pressure from their LNG export customers to deliver natural gas with lower greenhouse gas emissions, particularly methane.

The sudden conversion of shale gas producers to the ESG religion echoes what analysts at energy investment bank Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. found among Permian Basin shale oil producers over the past two years. The key finding of a summer 2021 research note released May 25, was the "1.8-time increase in operators reporting ESG data since Q1 2019 in investor relations reports, as investors are increasingly focused on climate change, clean energy transition, diversity, and reducing environmental impacts from oil and gas operations."

On Nov. 19, 2020, S&P Global Ratings hosted an industry roundtable to delve into the rapidly evolving world of sustainable covered bonds and assess the impact of COVID-19 on the product. We spoke to portfolio managers, investment strategists, industry representatives, and bankers.

According to our sell-side panelist, there are several reasons behind the delayed pick-up in sustainable covered bond issuance. First, the underlying assets have to meet the criteria of issuers' green or sustainable frameworks, as well as existing eligibility requirements for covered bond collateral pools.

Accountants at publicly traded U.S. coal companies are bringing company books in line with the declining market for the once-dominant fuel, with four U.S. coal companies reporting about $1.80 billion in asset impairments during the second quarter alone. The companies booking impairments pointed to lower long-term expectations for some coal assets as the sector also deals with the near-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In the time of coronavirus, protecting and promoting the health of both the global population and the global economy is a complex balancing act. “While the COVID-19 narrative across East Asia, then Europe, and the U.S. has been broadly consistent despite variations in the intensity of measures, emerging markets are struggling to contain the spread of the virus,” S&P Global Ratings Chief Economist Paul Gruenwald said in a recent report.

Cracks are starting to show in utility support for using natural gas as a bridge fuel to a low-carbon future. Some signs that the narrative is shifting include a recently canceled major gas pipeline project and a raft of utilities setting net-zero emissions targets amid changing customer preferences, new state mandates, and investor concerns that the recent glut of gas generation and pipeline investments could result in stranded assets.

Christi Tezak of the research firm ClearView Energy Partners LLC said the trend away from natural gas as a bridge fuel started long before Dominion and Duke canceled the ACP. She noted that some states have indicated they are not interested in expanding gas infrastructure.

Where can environmental, social, and governance (ESG) benchmarks help investors and markets most? The answer may be in emerging markets, where it is crucially important to identify and navigate ESG concerns.

The S&P/BMV Total Mexico ESG Index is built with the same philosophy underpinning the creation of many popular new ESG indices around the world, such as the S&P 500 ESG Index. The idea is that certain ESG indices should be more inclusive than exclusive to remain broad and diversified, such that the ESG index has a risk/return profile resembling that of the market, while providing an improved ESG profile.

Now, on the global stage, a surge of new insurance and insurtech companies have recently debuted in the marketplace worldwide, marking the highest recorded value for the sector since the first quarter of 2016—totaling approximately $1.88 billion from eight initial public offerings in the first quarter of this year, according to an S&P Global Market Intelligence analysis.

In the U.S., misogynoir—the dual oppression of sexism and racism that actualizes in misogyny against Black women—carries a significant social and economic cost for the country. According to research from S&P Global’s Diversity Research Lab, the U.S. economy would have generated an additional $107 billion in economic activity from 1960-2019 if the educational attainment of Black women had kept pace with that of white women, with all other factors constant.

Asset management firms continue to be pressured by investors, consumers, and regulators to develop and manage appropriate ESG strategies. They are looking to dig deeper on a range of ESG factors that are expected to have an impact on a company’s growth, profitability, capital efficiency, and risk exposure.

With costs falling for renewable power, the longevity of the gas sector depends on cost competitiveness and its flexibility to back up intermittent power sources.Changes in gas use will in turn dictate demand for pipeline capacity, with some assets at risk of becoming stranded. Other pipelines stand to benefit from growing liquefied natural gasdemand and forays into hydrogen blending in the gas stream.

Our analysis considers a transaction's potential exposure to ESG credit factors. For RMBS, we view the exposure to environmental credit factors as average, social credit factors as above average, and governance credit factors as below average (see "ESG Industry Report Card: Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities", published on March 31, 2021).

To achieve these two goals this year, there appears to be a preference among investors for listed securities in Asia and private market assets in North America. At the same time, the influence of technology as well as environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors is stronger than ever, both in terms of target assets and the investment process.

Edison's plan specifies which types of energy investments are eligible for funds it will raise from bond issuances and other finance instruments and which are not. Clean transportation, renewable energy and energy efficiency projects are included, for example, but nuclear energy and large hydroelectric investments are not because investors typically avoid such projects, Murphy said.

“Multinational corporations with substantial overseas earnings largely in sectors such as technology and health care would be subject to significant international tax changes to end offshoring and profit-shifting incentives under the Biden tax proposal. We believe most U.S. companies would have somewhat higher effective tax rates and pay higher cash taxes, and multinational corporations with foreign earnings would pay even more absent tax planning,” S&P Global Ratings said in a recent report.

S&P Global’s Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA) asks questions about emerging risks, risk culture, and risk governance. This article analyzes companies reporting on emerging risks and shows how a strong risk culture can arm companies with useful tools to both identify and prepare for these events.

As policymakers, corporations and investors prepare to reopen business with reduced or few restrictions – we examine the 2021 imperative to reframe and rebuild existing environmental, social and governance frameworks to build resilient, sustainable corporate and community ecosystems. Join S&P Global Market Intelligence for an in-depth discussion with Sustainable1 analysts and distinguished noted influencers within environmental, social, governance (ESG).

As long-term custodians of assets, insurers are experiencing a great deal of change, and are under pressure to address the impact of ESG risks on both sides of the balance sheet. Governments and regulators are explicitly focusing their attention on ESG risks – including climate change – that pose a grave issue for insurers.

As the world starts to look to the future, embedding and adopting ESG into banks strategies has never been more important. With the continued drive towards a low-carbon economy, plus the pressure from regulators and policymakers, the most competitive banks are already moving to take advantage of the situation.

"The attack on the industry will go on. I do not see the president changing his discourse and allowing the participation of private companies in the sector," Paul Alejandro Sanchez Campos, a Mexico-based energy consultant, told S&P Global Platts, adding that President Lopez Obrador’s attack on energy liberalization won’t escalate much further if his party doesn’t win a majority, but the energy sector will likely remain stagnant for at least three more years.

Job and mobility trends are improving in the world’s biggest economy, but rising prices are dampening consumers’ enthusiasm, according to S&P Global Ratings Chief U.S. Economist Beth Ann Bovino.

As of May 31, 2021, we've completed 83 ESG evaluations, including seven new evaluations. We published five new ESG evaluations and published an update on one evaluation.

Investor concerns regarding ESG issues have already emerged. In May 2020, Norway's sovereign wealth fund removed Canada's largest oil and gas producers, CNRL, Cenovus, Imperial Oil, and Suncor, from its US$1 trillion investment portfolio, citing concerns over the oil companies' GHG emissions.

Rio Tinto now faces strong local opposition to development of its major Jadar lithium project in Serbia – where the government may hold a referendum to find out citizens' views on the project - and had approval withdrawn for development of its proposed Arizona, US Resolution Copper mine. Trader Gerald Group recently restarted its Sierra Leone iron ore mine after admitting the government as a stakeholder after a two-year-long permit confiscation.

“As the global economy recovers from the current pandemic and as record levels of monetary and fiscal stimulus are pumped into the global economy, inflation has returned to the vocabulary of many investors. As the last period of prolonged inflation occurred decades ago, most market participants have not experienced it.

How to effectively treat environmental, social and governance issues, collectively known as ‘ESG’, is shaping up to be one of the most significant agendas of our time and is becoming a major strategic imperative, especially for large and public organizations. The ESG mandate is, however, challenging for many companies to embrace – it is broad and complex, and still immature in need of more industry standardization.

The 11 funds that underperformed compared to the S&P 500 saw a price increase ranging from 2.6% for the Brown Advisory Sustainable Growth Fund managed by Brown Advisory LLC to 10.6% for the SPDR S&P 500 Fossil Fuel Reserves Free ETF managed by a unit of State Street Global Advisors Inc. The SPDR S&P 500 Fossil Fuel Reserves Free ETF performed the same as the S&P 500 during the first year of the pandemic and appears to thus far be tracking closely heading into mid-2021.

With many Western integrated oil companies starting to wind down their oil and gas investments and selling upstream assets as they pivot to cleaner energy, commodity traders have been tipped to pick up some of the resources being shed by renewable-focused energy majors.

The state has implemented comprehensive policies to protect critical resources and reduce the state's carbon footprint. In addition to aggressive renewable energy standards, the state's water conservation requirements for retail water suppliers will be effective in the near-term.

Canadian oil and gas producers have also made significant progress overall in reducing per-barrel emissions, but total greenhouse gas emissions from conventional oil and gas and oil sands development have increased substantially since 1990, Michelle Dathorne, director of Canadian oil and gas for S&P Global Ratings, said.

Businesses across the U.S. are boosting e-commerce investments even as the COVID-19 pandemic winds down, part of a strategy to lock in revenue from consumers who have converted to online shopping over the last year. Eight in 10 surveyed organizations are prioritizing investments in e-commerce operations equally, or ahead of, in-store experiences, according to the Voice of the Enterprise: Customer Experience & Commerce: Merchant Study conducted by 451 Research, an offering of S&P Global Market Intelligence.

Seven years and one pandemic later, Brazil's central bank Banco Central do Brasil is stepping up its environmental, social and governance, or ESG, regulatory framework. To do so, it is putting together a list of ESG risks that banks will have to incorporate into their credit models.

Our key sustainability factors identify the most material environmental and social risks assessed in our ESG Evaluation. We assess the materiality of those risks across the industry’s value chain and reflect them in the weighting of our environmental and social factors.

The quality and scale of lithium reserves in other countries such as Chile surpass much of what the U.S. has to offer, according to Albemarle Chief Technical Officer Glen Merfeld. That means optimizing sustainable extraction technologies, such as direct lithium extraction or ion exchange solvent extraction, remains critical, Merfeld said during a June 14 roundtable hosted by the U.S. Energy Department.

In this next chapter, the S&P Dividend Aristocrats Series expands its scope beyond financial sustainability to include ESG considerations. Five indices have been launched as part of the newly created S&P ESG Dividend Aristocrats Series, offering access to multiple geographical regions including the U.S., global, and Europe (see Exhibit 2).

Bitcoin's high energy consumption is hardly news, but it hit the headlines afresh when Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk tweeted May 12 that the electric-car company would no longer accept payments in bitcoin due to its environmental impact. The price of bitcoin sank by $4,425.74 to $52,147.82 on May 13.

Given the battery sector is still experimenting with a complex technology, we believe firms face serious product liability risks. Ford, Hyundai Motor Co., General Motors, and BMW have recalled vehicles due to battery-related risks, including fire incidents.

Initial unemployment claims have sustained a decline of an average 26,000 per week since May and 9,000 total during the first week of June—from the 800,000 claims that held for nine months from August 2020 through April 2021—due to stronger labor demand from the more labor-intensive service sector and other businesses at large, according to S&P Global Ratings Chief U.S. Economist Beth Ann Bovino.

Even though Enbridge is the first among North American midstream giants to connect ESG goals to its funding strategy to incentivize achievements, Gibson Energy Inc., a much smaller Canadian operator, announced in April that it converted a $750 million revolving credit facility into a sustainability-linked revolving credit facility. The bond's performance indicators include the reduction of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 15% by 2025 as well as achieving 21% to 23% representation of racial and ethnic minority groups in its workforce, increasing representation of women to at least 40% of the board and the workforce, and appointing at least one board member identifying as Indigenous or from a racial or ethnic minority by 2025.

U.S. banks are feeling pressure from both politicians and competitors to adjust their overdraft fees, which account for a significant portion of revenue at some lenders. "Federal regulators for too long were asleep at the switch allowing an incremental fee to become the main business model for a couple of banks," said Aaron Klein, a senior fellow at Brookings Institution.

The steel tariffs specifically have also accomplished another Biden priority, which is confronting planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions. Steel production in China is more carbon-intensive than U.S. output.

Deal-making has increased as U.S. media companies scurry to snatch up and consolidate content makers. In May, 104 media and telecommunication services sector deals were announced with disclosed transaction values, up notably year-over-year from the 68 announced in May 2020, according to an S&P Global Market Intelligence analysis.

Issuers of sustainability-linked bonds pledge to improve their performance against tailor-made ESG targets and link this commitment directly to the coupon paid to investors. Italian energy group Enel SpA issued a first-of-its-kind $1.5 billion five-year bond in September 2019, which had a 2.65% annual coupon if the company reached a target of 55% renewable energy installed capacity by 2021.

"The extension of safeguard measures of the EU is the right and appropriate decision in light of the current challenges as the structural distortions of the global steel industry which are the U.S. steel tariffs and global overcapacity," Hans Jürgen Kerkhoff, head of the German steel industry association WV Stahl, told S&P Global Platts. "These continue despite economic recovery.

"The pandemic ended up being an accelerator on this issue in a much more convincing way," Octavio de Lazari, CEO of Banco Bradesco SA, said. Together with Itaú Unibanco Holding SA and Banco Santander (Brasil) SA, the largest private banks in Brazil launched the "Amazon plan" in 2020, a set of goals to help in the sustainable development of the rainforest region.

ResponsibleSteel, whose members include steelmaker ArcelorMittal and leading coking coal miner BHP Group, would certify both low-emissions steel and steel with higher carbon intensity with separate classifications, and based on certified steel meeting the raw materials standard, she said.

Despite stronger-than-expected GDP growth in the first quarter of this year, propelled by domestic demand and the performance of the service sector, many emerging economies have confronted new waves of coronavirus infections that have led to renewed lockdowns and may ultimately constrict activity, according to S&P Global Ratings. Companies across these emerging markets may face elevated credit risks.

Some commentators (see Fiedler et al., 2021; Hain et al., 2021; Nissan et al., 2019; Pindyck, 2017) have further cautioned against the rapid (unsupervised) uptake of climate risk analytics, highlighting the potential for unintended misuse in the context of financial decision-making and disclosures. As Fiedler explains, the potential implications of misuse are widespread.

The energy transition from fossil-based systems of energy production and consumption—including oil, natural gas, and coal—to renewable energy sources such as wind and solar is already underway as the race toward decarbonization intensifies. The passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework would likely revolutionize outdated power distribution systems that are vulnerable to extreme weather events and worsening climate risk, and can’t meet the increased demand that rising electrification will bring.

"Scope 3 emissions are approximately 90% of an upstream oil and gas companies' emissions, and every major investor-led group working on climate change expects such companies to report them, so leaving that out is a glaring omission," Schuwerk said. "You would think that upstream oil and gas companies would be focused almost exclusively on Scope 3 emissions — not just because they are 90% of emissions, but because the use of their products causes the [greenhouse gas] emissions.”

Alongside their differing economic conditions, inflation may affect regions in different ways according to recent outlooks from S&P Global Economics. Asia-Pacific economies face transitory inflation risks that should ease, but a prolonged uneven global recovery could destabilize capital flows in the region.

China's carbon emissions trading plans to keep steel on uptrend in long run

The S&P/ASX 200 ESG Index is broad and constructed to play a central role in an investment strategy, unlike many ESG indices that have preceded it, which were thematic or narrow in their focus. By targeting 75% of the S&P/ASX 200’s market capitalization, industry by industry, the S&P/ASX 200 ESG Index offers industry diversification and a return profile in line with Australia’s leading benchmark.

On May 24, 2021, Leveraged Commentary & Data (LCD) unveiled their ESG Leveraged Finance Tracker (ESG Tracker), a list that tracks loans and high-yield bonds in the U.S. and European markets that have an ESG component (see "Introducing LCD's ESG Leveraged Finance Tracker," published May 24, 2021). LCD intends to update this list weekly.

As cyberattacks increase in sophistication and frequency, U.S. public finance (USPF) issuers must embed cybersecurity into their comprehensive risk-mitigation strategies. We consider risk management and mitigation a governance factor under environmental, social, and governance (ESG).

To date, institutional investor retrenchment from the Canadian oil and gas industry has been less direct than the shareholder activism that has occurred in the U.S. Some large foreign institutional investors have reduced their investment in several Canadian oil and gas companies, particularly those focused on oil sands development and production, due to their concerns about the producers' ability to reduce their emissions profiles.

Different economies may use natural gas for different purposes as they work to control their carbon emissions, yet the viability of natural gas during the transition into a low-carbon world hinges on the industry’s ability to uphold its net-zero targets. Oil and gas companies have endured mounting pressure to clean up their value chains and take meaningful action to reduce their sizable emissions.

Ultimately, the possibility of having insufficient resources to meet debt obligations is central to our credit analysis. Management's ability to manage its cash flow and identify potential issues, internal or external, is essential to ensure full and timely payment of debt service.

In this edition, we take a closer look at environmental concerns weighing on tariff talks and cryptocurrency investments. As U.S. and EU officials work to resolve differences on steel and aluminum duties, the Biden administration is facing pressure to keep measures in place to stem global excess capacity and resolve alleged market inequities.

There were 34 ESG-related rating actions (including rating-, outlook- and CW-changes) in May; of which 22 were downgrades. Governance and social factors each drove 16 rating actions, and two rating actions were impacted by environmental considerations.

Taking a more proactive role in shaping both the national and regional health care systems. We believe the main social role of health care facilities is to provide access to affordable and high-quality care.

In Asia-Pacific economies, rating trends are diverging—positively for those in East Asia who have controlled the spread of the coronavirus and negatively for countries across South and Southeast Asia fighting renewed outbreaks. Europe’s policy interventions have protected the eurozone economy from severe credit deterioration.

In Greater China, there are many opportunities for innovative ESG structures, such as sustainability-linked bonds, UBS said. In January, Hong Kong real estate giant New World Development Co. Ltd. issued 10-year sustainability-linked bonds, which were oversubscribed six times by investors from Asia and Europe in the first public bond of its kind in Asia excluding Japan.

Challenges remain at two levels: fund-level ESG management and portfolio-company-level ESG performance reporting. As I mentioned before even listed companies are at an early stage of managing ESG performance and reporting externally.

The growing focus on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks and opportunities that forced changes across oil majors’ boards and institutional investor divestments could affect demand and pricing for oil and gas companies' new debt issuance, according to S&P Global Ratings. Better credit is available to oil companies that produce less carbon, according to S&P Global Ratings, which found in recent research that oil companies pay more for capital in the bond market when they release more emissions.

In this edition, we take a closer look at bank merger-and-acquisition activity in the U.S. After a very quiet 2020, Ohio saw three bank deals announced in June alone. On fundamental banking performance, the state's community banks largely lagged the broader industry during the first quarter.

The pace of auto insurers' adoption of telematics has varied widely. But dramatic changes in driving behaviors prompted by COVID-19 have accelerated the relevance and application of the technology for insurers and policyholders alike.

In this publication, we examine the aggregate asset quality held by European CLOs, observed through key credit metrics and consolidated by S&P Global Ratings' CLO industry sectors. Specifically, this edition of sector average metrics for European CLO assets focuses on loans issued by 677 corporate issuers, which represents over 95% of the assets under management (AUM) held in reinvesting European CLOs rated by S&P Global Ratings as reported at March 31.

The S&P GSCI rose 31.4% in the first half of 2021, outperforming the S&P 500®, which rose 15.2%. The S&P GSCI has more than doubled since hitting an all-time low during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020.

S&P Global Platts Analytics anticipates global oil demand could climb 8.8 million barrels per day from June to December of this year. Similarly, OPEC expects oil demand to gain momentum alongside the accelerating global economic recovery during the second half of this year.

More compelling evidence supports the presence of a greenium, at least in certain sectors. An analysis by S&P Dow Jones Indices (SPDJI) sought to isolate and highlight a investor greenium by constructing credit curves of similar bond issuance.

In the U.S., regulations implemented since the GFC—related to banks’ capital and liquidity, underwriting, operational risk, and governance—have bolstered their resilience. Most banks were displaying good financial performance prior to the COVID-19 shock, and the pandemic’s hit to credit losses and earnings has been less severe than we first thought.

Next, it is necessary to assess the materiality of ESG risks each borrower is exposed to, directly and indirectly, using ESG Heat Maps. Material ESG risks are those that are likely to affect the financial condition or operating performance of a business.

In this week's newsletter, we also dive into a new report by 451 Research into how 30 technology trends are playing out across each of the environmental, social and governance dimensions of ESG. And we examine transmission challenges associated with building offshore wind, as well as how the steel industry may need government support to decarbonize.

Incorporating environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors in credit risk analysis is fast becoming an international best practice and is a mandatory requirement of the European Banking Authority (EBA) Guidelines on Loan Origination and Monitoring that came into effect on 30th June 2021. [1]

All of these examples suggest that a greenium may be present in certain sectors, providing a pricing benefit to issuers who can demonstrate the required ESG credentials, but this evidence is not definitive given the various factors that influence bond pricing. Furthermore, liquidity in sustainable debt markets is unlikely to approach the levels of conventional markets until the sustainable debt markets make further progress in addressing its key challenges.

S&P Global Platts Analytics expects that an agreement could result in sanctions relief by September—boosting Iran’s crude and condensate exports to 1.5 million barrels per day by December, from 600,000 barrels per day in May. The country produced 2.43 million barrels per day of crude in May, marking a notable increase from the 1.98 million barrels per day seen in July 2020 but from from a pre-sanction high of 3.83 million in May 2018, according to a recent S&P Global Platts OPEC+ survey.

Redbox Automated Retail LLC, which is in the process of going public via a reverse merger with special purpose acquisition company Seaport Global Acquisition Corp., is aiming to evolve its business beyond its legacy DVD rental kiosks to include more revenue from streaming partnerships, ad-supported content and other business.

The exclusions serve to highlight the performance of relatively smaller coins that are overshadowed by the dominance of the two largest coins—which make up approximately 63% of total market capitalization.3 Exhibit 2 shows how the index’s average coin market capitalization diminishes dramatically as mega- and large-cap constituents are excluded—from almost USD 5 billion in the S&P Cryptocurrency BDM Index, to USD 1.1 billion in the S&P Cryptocurrency BDM Ex-MegaCap Index, to just USD 230 million in the S&P Cryptocurrency BDM Ex-LargeCap Index.

Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues continue to gain the attention of consumers, investors, and other stakeholders who are putting pressure on businesses throughout the economy to take steps to move to a low-carbon environment. As a result, gathering appropriate metrics and reporting on ESG strategies are fast becoming business imperatives.

After peaking in March, China’s steel production would have to decline 10% year-over-year to match 2020’s output, according to S&P Global Platts’ analysis of China’s National Bureau of Statistics data. But market sources told S&P Global Platts that China’s steel demand may not decline in the second half of the year since the output reductions to be implemented from July-December may lead to steel supply shortages, higher prices, and increased pressure on manufacturers.

Apart from the European oil, Australia's low carbon oil and gas cargoes are rapidly gaining popularity among Asian end-users looking to enhance and incorporate their ESG considerations, with Thailand and Japan actively picking up Ichthys condensate and LNG spot cargoes.

In this edition, we explore recent consolidation trends in the U.S. banking industry. The number of banks in the country with more than $50 billion in assets has increased by one-third since 2018, when lawmakers voted to roll back some of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act.

Mark Haefele, Chief Investment Officer at UBS and Alexandra Dimitrijevic, Global Head of Research at S&P Global Ratings joined Joe Cass on this edition of Fixed Income in 15.

The preliminary ratings assigned to CIM Retail Portfolio Trust 2021-RETL's commercial mortgage pass-through certificates reflect S&P Global Ratings' view of the collateral's historical and projected performance, the sponsor's and managers' experience, the trustee-provided liquidity, the loan's terms, and the transaction's structure. We determined that the trust loan has a beginning and ending loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of 85.4%, based on S&P Global Ratings' value.

Additional extreme climate events have recently occurred elsewhere with similarly destructive outcomes: Wildfires that raged across California last summer and are burning in Oregon left millions without power, the polar vortex that froze Texas this winter destabilized critical energy infrastructure, and some scientists believe sea level rise could have been a factor in the condo collapse in Florida last month. No longer “black swan” events, the increasing physical risks of climate change are propelling heightened interest in climate risk analytics and greater attention on governments’ climate action.

Andrew Logan, senior director for oil and gas at nonprofit investor network Ceres, said he has fielded inquiries from several investors about what Project Canary calls responsibly sourced gas, or RSG. However, it also competes directly with renewable natural gas, which is refined from methane waste sources such as farms and landfills instead of fossil fuels.

Our key sustainability factors identify the most material environmental and social risks assessed in our ESG Evaluation. We assess the materiality of those risks across the industry’s value chain and reflect them in the weighting of our environmental and social factors.

The 2016 Paris Climate Agreement resulted in many countries pledging to net zero goals. Net zero, also referred to as carbon neutrality, is the scenario wherein the carbon or greenhouse emissions are balanced by absorbing the same from the atmosphere.

“As gasoline and food prices resurged since February, consumer short-term inflation expectations jumped around in the range of 4.2%-4.8%: rising to 4.6% in May, dipping to 4.2% in June, and hitting 4.8% in early July (compared with 2.5% precrisis), due to the high visibility of these prices in daily life. However, long-term inflation expectations from the financial markets' point of view seem to have stabilized, with the five-year forward looking inflation rate expected five years from now, a reflection of financial market participants' long-term inflation expectations (five to 10 year time horizon), increasing at a slower pace since February and retreating from its peak in May,” S&P Global Ratings Chief U.S.

There were 31 ESG-related credit rating actions in June, including seven downgrades and six upgrades. Social factors drove 55% of last month’s ESG-related credit rating actions, and 30% and 15% were driven by governmental and environmental factors, respectively.

As European nations have lifted the majority of their lockdown measures, mobility has soared to the highest levels since the crisis took hold in March 2020— approximately 12% below pre-pandemic levels in Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and the U.K., according to an S&P Global Platts analysis of Google data. With regional and international travel restrictions still in place, the potential for a slower-than-expected recovery in regional jet fuel demand remains.

Real estate operators are primarily exposed to climate change, given the need to use energy to heat or cool buildings. Efforts to enhance the sustainable credentials of a real estate asset can enhance the issuer's operating efficiency (by conserving energy, reducing water usage, and managing waste), reduce operating costs, and encourage environmental benchmarks to monitor assets.

Environmental risks for metals and mining companies are among the highest across all sectors. Main social tensions arise from fears of pollution, water usage conflicts, and economic/landscape impacts on nearby communities.

Silos within the energy industry are coming down as companies confront the need to dramatically cut carbon emissions. The so-called energy convergence is the idea that companies, policy makers and regulators need to be more collaborative across the energy spectrum.

Our key sustainability factors identify the most material environmental and social risks assessed in our ESG Evaluation. We assess the materiality of those risks across the industry’s value chain and reflect them in the weighting of our environmental and social factors.

The flexibility of sustainability-linked loans makes them particularly attractive to so-called hard-to-abate borrowers, such as those in the transportation, chemicals and heavy industries sectors, who have taken up the product to a greater extent than anticipated, said Kevin Ranney, director of advisory services at Sustainalytics, which advises issuers on such loans. These sectors are among the top users of sustainability-linked loans, according to Nordea Research, which called the instrument "a relevant alternative for entities within sectors that are not green by nature."

The Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which would bring gas from Russia to Germany, is 98% complete and expected to be completed by the end of August, despite warnings of U.S. sanctions and threats that the new infrastructure poses to Ukraine’s transit, according to S&P Global Platts. In the U.S., environmental and social opposition prompted the formal termination of TC Energy’s Keystone XL pipeline in June.

Linde PLC, Air Liquide SA and Air Products & Chemicals Inc., which derive between about 10% and 25% of their total revenue from producing gray hydrogen, made with fossil fuels, are set to be key players as momentum builds globally around the production of low-carbon hydrogen. That includes green hydrogen, made with renewable electricity, and blue hydrogen, produced with natural gas and carbon capture technology.

The Dow Jones Select Green RESI Series is based on the Dow Jones Select RESI Series, which are widely used, listed real estate indices with approximately USD 23 billion in index-linked assets. The indices also use GRESB’s widely followed real estate assessment, which incorporates property-level data that measure such criteria as energy and water usage, carbon emissions, and leasable area covered by green building certifications—offering a deep, specialized sustainability analysis for real estate companies.

“The U.S. economy continued its strong reopening in June, with real GDP, in dollars, reaching its precrisis peak in the second quarter. According to our June baseline forecast, we expect that U.S. GDP will climb to its precrisis growth path in the third quarter this year, with stronger service consumption and cooler, but more sustainable, durable goods consumption and residential investment,” S&P Global Ratings Chief U.S.

Duke Energy has been the subject of Elliott Investment Management’s attention, a position no company wants to find itself in. The activist investor last week reiterated its concerns over the utility company’s leadership team, citing “anemic EPS growth and poor returns for shareholders as a result of avoidable operational, investment and strategic setbacks."

Aligning portfolios with the taxonomy is a challenge for investors. Netherlands-based asset manager NN Investment Partners said in a July 19 report that 60% of its green bond portfolio was aligned to the EU taxonomy.

“We have seen more credit-relevant cyber events in the last six months than in the previous six years. Almost all recent attacks involved ransomware demands and highlighted attackers' ability to choose targets without regard for geography or sector,” S&P Global Ratings said in report earlier this month detailing the credit risks that come from cyberattacks.

Demand for environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment products has grown substantially, with a 10-fold increase1 in inflows to ESG funds from 2018 to 2020 just in the U.S. The SFDR is an EU regulation that seeks greater transparency from firms marketing investment products in the EU that have an explicit sustainable investment objective, an environmental or social characteristic and even products that do not consider ESG (as mentioned in this SFDR primer2).

EQT has had an active last year of M&A activity, most recently acquiring gas producer Alta Resources. The Alta acquisition added around 300,000 acres of Marcellus production to EQT's portfolio, 300 miles of midstream gathering systems, and around 1 Bcf/d of dry gas production.

The International Energy Agency proclaimed 2020 as the year of fastest growth for global renewable electricity sources in two decades. Amid the coronavirus crisis’ hit to energy markets, renewable energy continued to grow globally in 2020 by a "colossal" 238 gigawatts—50% more than at any time in history—led by solar and wind generation, BP chief economist Spencer Dale said during a Columbia University Center on Global Energy Policy panel discussion earlier this month, according to S&P Global Platts.

According to the EPA, Scope 3 emissions come from assets not owned or controlled by a reporting company but are still connected to the organization's value chain. Scope 1 emissions are direct greenhouse gas emissions from sources controlled or owned by the company, and Scope 2 emissions are indirect greenhouse gas emissions tied to the company's purchase of electricity, steam, heat or cooling.

On May 24, 2021, Leveraged Commentary & Data (LCD) unveiled its ESG Leveraged Finance Tracker, a list that tracks loans and high-yield bonds in the U.S. and European markets that have an environmental, social, and governance (ESG) component. LCD intends to update this list weekly.

Following an unprecedented U.S. transition to power, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. took the oath of office on January 20, 2021. How will the Biden Administration establish a strategic agenda, as the country looks to recover from an economic downturn, with a rising tide of COVID-19 and vaccination rollout?

In the RMBS segment, we assigned ratings to monthly RMBS and series T notes issued by JHF, and transactions backed by housing loan receivables originated by Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. (SMBC): the ¥46.8 billion SMBC Residential Mortgage Trust Certificates No. 45 and the ¥7.4 billion SMBC 45 RMBS ABL (asset-backed loans).

Asset managers and owners subject to SFDR will also look at fossil fuel exposure as a potential risk. Under SFDR, companies with fossil fuel exposure are those that make money from oil and gas exploration, coal mining, and the distribution or refining of coal, oil and gas.

Climate disasters such as hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires continually expose vulnerabilities of U.S. infrastructure. In this episode, Corinne Bendersky and Mike Ferguson discuss the Senate’s recently announced bipartisan infrastructure package and its implications related to ESG.

The S&P/ASX 200 ESG Index is broad and constructed to play a central role in an investment strategy, unlike many ESG indices that have preceded it, which were thematic or narrow in their focus. By targeting 75% of the S&P/ASX 200’s market capitalization, industry by industry, the S&P/ASX 200 ESG Index offers industry diversification and a return profile in line with Australia’s leading benchmark.

The size of the overall ESG debt market nearly doubled to $608.8 billion last year, from $326 billion in 2019, according to Environmental Finance. Green bonds, typically used to fund climate change mitigation projects, at $295.85 billion made up nearly half of the total ESG debt in 2020.

Typically, we assess the midstream industry as higher risk than the utility industry, even when the midstream assts are high-quality assets with long-term contracts. The midstream industry is exposed to commodity risks, counterparty credit risks, volumetric risks, and associated environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks.

"Private debt funds can also typically move a little faster than broadly syndicated markets with fewer points of contact, no syndication materials required, very little in the way of ratings involvement, and so on. In addition, pricing in the private debt markets has reduced significantly from the pricing levels seen in 2012, for example, owing to a low-interest rate environment and the availability of significant dry powder.

Natural gas producers are partnering with data companies to reduce emissions amid growing pressure to decarbonize supplies. This episode features interviews with Chris Romer, the co-founder and CEO of Project Canary, and Andrew Baxter, the Environmental Defense Fund's director of energy strategy.

In this edition, we take a closer look at the remuneration increases of CEOs at some of the highest profile U.S. companies in various industries in 2020. Jamie Dimon, who has been at the helm of JPMorgan since 2005, saw his compensation rise 0.2% on a yearly basis.

Muni bonds come in two varieties: general obligation and revenue bonds. General obligation bonds are used to finance public projects that aren't linked to a particular revenue stream.

The preliminary ratings assigned to OBX 2021-NQM3 Trust's mortgage-backed notes reflect our view of: The pool's collateral composition (see the Collateral Summary section below); The transaction's credit enhancement, associated structural mechanics, representation and warranty (R&W) framework, and geographic concentration; The mortgage aggregator, Onslow Bay Financial LLC (Onslow Bay), and the originators, which include AmWest Funding Corp and Sprout Mortgage LLC; and The impact the COVID-19 pandemic will likely have on the performance of the mortgage borrowers in the pool and liquidity available in the transaction. Our rating analysis considers a transaction's potential exposure to ESG credit factors.

Of the 10 countries in the analysis, Greece, Italy, Spain and Belgium are most exposed to water stress between now and 2050, followed by Germany, France, Hungary and the U.K. Water stress refers to the combination of both reduced water availability (rainfall) and increased water demand (population, industrial and agricultural use). So even in parts of Europe where rainfall might increase as a result of a warming climate, more water demand could trigger water stress.

"The Europeans are looking to introduce a battery passport, so materials used for batteries that are imported from abroad must have a passport that shows what the [ESG] profile is."

And our expectations are evolving. Our expectations are that our clients are going to assess and report their greenhouse gas initiatives.

China launched its long-awaited carbon emissions trading system, starting with its power sector, on June 16 after the introduction of the system was postponed due to the country’s caution over how an unregulated carbon market could socioeconomically affect different provinces. First-day activity was frenzied and showed promise for the world’s largest voluntary carbon market.

On completion of the transaction, BHP's oil and gas business will merge with Woodside, and Woodside will issue new shares to be distributed to BHP shareholders. The expanded Woodside will be 52% owned by existing Woodside shareholders and 48% by existing BHP shareholders, the release said.

There is a lot of discussion in Australia about climate change, and all financial regulators have some degree of climate reporting in their guidelines, although there are no mandatory requirements at the moment. While voluntary reporting is encouraged, it is not leading to the quality and consistency that is essential for investors to be able to integrate climate risks and opportunities into their decision-making.

“Fighting climate change has become a top priority for European governments and policymakers. The financial sector will be instrumental in facilitating the transition to low- or zero-carbon economies now targeted by policymakers, but the transition itself could pose financial and operational risks for these firms,” S&P Global Ratings said in a recent report.

In this edition, we take a closer look at the rebound of bank M&A in the U.S. as deal activity continued to climb back to pre-pandemic levels. Over just the first seven months of this year, banks have announced 116 deals, compared with 111 over all of 2020. Credit unions also remain on the hunt for U.S. bank acquisitions as they use secondary capital to expand their deal capacity.

Strong metals prices are supporting mining and discovery. As the size of exploration budgets typically align with metals prices within a one-year lag, high metals prices are likely to expand exploration budgets by 25%-35% this year, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence’s forecast.

As a foundation of normalization from the coronavirus-caused economic downturn sprouts across countries, banks previously burdened with declining asset quality and creditworthiness—alongside increasing demand for lending—are enjoying rebounding earnings and profits. The first half of this year saw robust earnings from banks in the U.K. that benefited from the release of massive credit provisions, according to S&P Global Ratings.

A lack of reliable and comparable ESG metrics and reporting is another key challenge to tackling confusion in the ESG space. In the absence of a common standard and enforcement mechanism for instrument-level ESG disclosure, the quality and consistency of post-issuance use of proceeds and impact reporting is still highly unstandardized and fragmented across issuer types and regions making it difficult to compare and aggregate performance.

As the U.S. economy recovers, the Biden Administration is looking to further strengthen the recovery with an infrastructure funding bill. S&P Global Ratings updated its projections on what impact a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure would have on the economy through 2030.

"ESG is something that many institutional investors inquire about as they explore digital assets, just as they ask about volatility and other considerations for this nascent asset class," a spokesperson for Fidelity Digital Assets Services, a subsidiary of Fidelity Investments and a provider of cryptocurrency custody and other services to institutional investors, told S&P Global Market Intelligence. "Today, a substantial portion of bitcoin mining is powered by renewable energy or energy that would otherwise be wasted (stranded gas) and miners are increasingly seeking more efficient and cleaner energy.”

In this edition, we take a close look at the second-quarter natural gas liquid, or NGL, revenues of top U.S. shale producers. Revenues skyrocketed amid rising prices from the same period a year earlier, as 10 of the largest oil and gas producers posted year-over-year boosts in realized NGL prices of 104% to as high as 261%.

“Key stakeholders, including consumers and investors, have started pressuring companies to demonstrate their ESG credentials either through commitments and actions at the corporate level, the products they offer, or the instruments they use for financing. Governments and regulators have also introduced enhanced standards and regulations to support increased disclosure and consistency of ESG reporting.

Asia is experiencing increased activity and mobility, which serves as a proxy for oil demand. Negative effects spurred by the delta variant in the largest Asian economies may not weigh as heavily as expected, according to S&P Global Platts.

In Canada, the telecom sector is facing a new frontier due to M&A deal-making. In the U.S., extra cash on balance sheets, low interest rates, and efforts to reposition for a post-pandemic world have driven a frenzy of private equity-sponsored M&A deals, totaling 341, in the first half of this year.

Our analysis considers a transaction's potential exposure to ESG credit factors. For RMBS, we view the exposure to environmental credit factors as average, social credit factors as above average, and governance credit factors as below average (see "ESG Industry Report Card: Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities," published on March 31, 2021).

Meanwhile, if you’re upstream and you’re producing your primary metal, prices are so high that you would be making money – doubling and tripling of EBITDA at the front end of the industry. In a few years to come, there may be more capital deployed organically rather than in acquisitions because most of the price hikes have already been flooded in the prices of the assets.

Traditionally, CLO documents typically had a free 5% allowance above which the portfolio manager was required to trap 50% of interest received from semi-annual or annual assets into the interest-smoothing accounts for the next payment date. Recent CLOs have amended these requirements.

More compelling evidence supports the presence of a greenium, at least in certain sectors. An analysis by S&P Dow Jones Indices (SPDJI) sought to isolate and highlight a investor greenium by constructing credit curves of similar bond issuance.

The new administration in the U.S. brings a significant change in tone on addressing climate risk. On Day 1 in office, President Joe Biden took steps to rejoin the Paris agreement on climate change and pledged to set the U.S. on the path to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 with an interim target of decarbonizing the U.S. power sector by 2035.

Climate change has created a need to evaluate the impact of different climate-related scenarios on counterparties, investments, and portfolios. To support these efforts, S&P Global Market Intelligence and Oliver Wyman present Climate Credit Analytics, a climate scenario analysis and credit analytics model suite.

We appreciate that the development of IFRS accounting standards can take several years and that this reflects the need to consult widely on complex topics. However, timelines for the development and application of sustainability reporting standards may need to be accelerated, so that investors, and companies can benefit from the intended standards for comparable, timely, and relevant disclosures on sustainability as soon as possible.

After the pandemic significantly impacted industrial activity, global steel markets, and downstream producers last year, 2021 is expected to bring forth a vastly improving outlook for most metals. The productive future of mining on a global scale will likely hinge on widespread adherence to ESG principles, including health and safety regulations, carbon emissions reduction, and clampdowns on illegal deforestation, across the industry.

As the COVID-19 pandemic has severely the global economy, new infrastructure could be the catalyst the global economy needs to regenerate productivity and growth following the coronavirus-caused downturn. Some countries’ public transport and airport sectors face short-term credit risks, while the world's financial market infrastructure companies see credit quality opportunities from stakeholders’ increasing focus environmental, social, and governance factors.

Michael Ferguson of S&P Global Ratings pointed out that S&P Global Ratings has been including climate risk exposure into credit ratings for some time. S&P Global Ratings has drawn on that experience in introducing their new ESG Evaluations which use the same group of industry and sectors analysts as the credit rating group.

Cybersecurity is solidifying as a top governance concern within environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations as cyberattacks increase in frequency and severity—alongside the financial losses and disruptions that can follow in their wake. The cyberattack on Colonial Pipeline, a main artery of the U.S. fuel supply, is the most recent incident that has raised questions over whether industries are adequately prepared to mitigate risk and safeguard vulnerabilities.

S&P Global Ratings has recently observed contracting bond tenors and widening spreads for North American oil and gas debt issuers, relative to those of European peers and the broader corporate fixed income universe, suggesting that investors' growing focus on ESG and credit risk may be affecting demand for new issuance from oil and gas companies.

As an intense storm traveled up the eastern U.S., more than 1 million electricity customers remained without power as of Sept. 1 from Louisiana to Pennsylvania, according to S&P Global Platts. Highlighting U.S. energy grid’s lack of resilience to severe climate events, hurricane Ida had left approximately 1.2 million customers in Louisiana in the dark during the disaster.

The first high-yield bond and leveraged loan to launch after the traditional late-summer break in Europe have both included sustainability language, in a signal that issuance linked to the principles of environmental, social, and governance criteria looks to set to make up an increasingly important part of the market in the latter part of this year. However, sustainable issuance across the high-yield bond and leveraged loan asset classes is still in its nascent stage, and that means many areas in the market are ripe for potential growth, change and development.

Our rating analysis considers a transaction's potential exposure to ESG credit factors. For RMBS, we view the exposure to environmental credit factors as average, social credit factors as above average, and governance credit factors as below average (see "ESG Industry Report Card: Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities," published on March 31, 2021).

Environmental risks are somewhat elevated for Palm Beach County given its location along Florida's southeastern coast, which makes it more susceptible to weather events and the effects of climate change. However, the county established an office of resilience (OOR) department and is a member of several organizations that plan and integrate capital improvements over the longer term to protect the property tax base from environmental risks.

The preliminary ratings assigned to BX Commercial Mortgage Trust 2021-VOLT's commercial mortgage pass-through certificates series 2021-VOLT reflect S&P Global Ratings' view of the collateral's historical and projected performance, the sponsor's and the manager's experience, the trustee-provided liquidity, the loan terms, and the transaction's structure. We determined that the mortgage loan has a beginning and ending loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of 116.7%, based on S&P Global Ratings' value.

Recent security threats in Nigeria, which has endured a long history of attacks on its energy infrastructure, have put the oil industry in Africa's largest oil producer and a key supplier of light sweet crude grades to Europe at risk. Major oil hotspots like Saudi Arabia and Iraq have endured attacks on critical infrastructure from Houthi and Islamic State fighters.

There has never been greater demand for methodological developments in high quality, relevant and reliable ESG data. This has been driven by the shifting regulatory landscape and the growing awareness of key risks and impacts.

CreditModel’s suite of statistical models, trained on credit ratings from S&P Global Ratings,[2] enables users to quickly evaluate the long-term creditworthiness of mid- and large-cap, public and private banks, insurance companies, and corporations globally. The models utilize financial statement and macroeconomic data to generate a quantitative credit score that statistically matches a credit rating from S&P Global Ratings.

The European insurance industry identified climate change as an emerging risk over two decades ago and has since campaigned for more action to be taken to mitigate its impact1. As Europe’s largest institutional investors, many look to insurance firms to assist with the transition to a low-carbon economy.

The chief marketing officer and head of IR wanted to create a picture of what the bank was doing on the ESG front. To support this effort, they needed data on the bank’s environmental footprint, including having a measure of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and other pollutants arising from its operations.

Market Intelligence discussed a consultative solution that would deliver actionable insights for divisions across the bank, along with an analytical framework and toolset that the environmental team could use on its own in the future. Market Intelligence would undertake a desk study, followed by an analysis of the bank’s financed emissions, the energy sector, and climate scenarios.

The task force needed access to comprehensive environmental data to create a baseline carbon footprint for the loan portfolio. With data on revenues and debt outstanding for each loan customer, it would be possible to calculate the portion of emissions being financed by the bank.

Carbon footprinting is a typical starting point for assessing the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with a portfolio, as it offers a baseline from which to mitigate risks. Carbon intensity (CI) is a measure that scales GHG emissions by company revenue to facilitate comparisons of emissions across entities of different sizes.

This capability, which was launched by Trucost at the end of 2019, could help the company quickly assess asset- and company-level exposure to physical risks under low, moderate, and high future climate change scenarios. By geo-locating the company’s assets on climate change hazard maps, Trucost would be able to identify locations that were vulnerable to climate risks, such as wildfire and sea level rise.

Natural disasters as the result of climate change are increasing in both intensity and frequency, resulting in significant financial losses for companies. A record number of hurricanes, wildfires, and floods exacerbated by climate change cost the world $210 billion U.S. in damages in 20201.

The Trucost Environmentally-Extended Input-Output (EEIO) model splits the world economy into more than 450 distinct business activities based on the North American Classification System (NAICS). The model calculates environmental impacts per million USD in revenue for each business activity, which can then be used to anticipate the most material impacts for a company based on its discrete business activities.

The Financial Stability Board established the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) to develop recommendations for more effective management of climate change risks in financial markets. TCFD advises the use of scenario analysis to assess climate risks, and asks banks to voluntarily reveal the results in annual filings, along with the metrics and processes used to conduct the analysis.

Trucost’s EU Taxonomy Revenue Share Dataset provides an assessment of the proportion of company revenues linked to the business activities outlined in the Taxonomy. The dataset covers 15,000+ listed companies, representing 98% of global market capitalization, and includes history back to 2005 to help assess how the Taxonomy-eligibility of company business activities has evolved over time.

The financial market needs to help facilitate an adequate flow of capital towards a low-carbon economy. To help investors track their portfolios and benchmarks against the goal of limiting global warming, we developed a transition pathway approach that examines the adequacy of a company’s emission reductions over time.

Accompanying the Trucost SDG Analytics Dataset is the Trucost SDG Revenue Share Dataset that enables investors to calculate the proportion of company revenues that are aligned to the SDGs. By aggregating the percentage of revenue for each company from the 17 SDGs, we arrived at a total percentage of a company’s revenue that is aligned to all SDGs.

S&P Global brings several proprietary data sets to bear on the issue. As shown in Figure 1 below, there are 22,000+ companies covered in the S&P Global Trucost environmental data set.1 By applying an array of cross reference and company relationship data, users are able to identify 954,000 related companies, along with 116 million associated financial instruments and a total of 4,922 credit ratings.

Data is a fundamental input to any successful ESG strategy to inform discovery, value creation and risk resilience. But not all data is alike.

Compounding extreme weather and climate-related events are also reshaping the insurance landscape. In the U.S. alone, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data shows that 2020 had 22 extreme weather and climate-related disasters, each with losses greater than $1 billion.

Although institutional investors continue to incorporate ESG into investment strategies, they said data quality and consistency are major barriers to further adoption. To deal with inconsistencies in ESG data, 73% of investors use and compare multiple sources of data, although doing so adds further complexity within the organization.

In 2020, Énergir purchased 15% of its system gas through its responsibly sourced gas initiative, and it expected purchases to exceed 20% this year, according to Vincent Regnault, director of gas supply and development of renewable gases at Énergir. Regnault said Énergir did not face much pushback over the cost premium from its regulator, but he acknowledged that it can be challenging to procure gas at anything but the lowest cost in some jurisdictions.

The preliminary ratings assigned to Benchmark 2021-B29 Mortgage Trust's commercial mortgage pass-through certificates reflect the credit support provided by the transaction's structure, our view of the underlying collateral's economics, the trustee-provided liquidity, the collateral pool's relative diversity, and our overall qualitative assessment of the transaction. S&P Global Ratings determined that the collateral pool has, on a weighted average basis, debt service coverage (DSC) of 2.22x and beginning and ending loan-to-value (LTV) ratios of 99.9% and 95.7%, respectively, based on our values.

"We're hearing a crescendo of voices calling for action on the climate, the phase-out of fossil fuel, and other sustainability goals … At the same time, we are also hearing a lot about near-term pressures needed to keep the lights on and the economy growing, and this is where the role of fossil fuels hasn't been very obvious,” S&P Global Platts Analytics' head of energy scenarios, policy and technology Roman Kramarchuk told S&P Global Platts. "There will clearly be tensions about how we get there [to the Paris Climate goals], particularly if there are perceptions that addressing long-term policy goals will complicate and make the here-and-now more expensive … The key questions are around the pace of change, new investments, the stranding of assets, around how quickly fossil fuels may be phased out and what roles they can continue to play under different outlooks."

The global transition to lower-carbon energy sources poses a credit risk to 96% of the oil and gas companies that Ratings covers. This category encompasses a company's carbon emissions and its efforts to minimize emissions and develop lower-carbon products, as well as the existential risk that oil and gas companies find their products severely restricted or outlawed, Ratings said Nov. 23.

Decarbonizing the EU’s gas market by transitioning from the unabated natural gas fossil fuel, on which European economies are currently heavily reliant, to low-carbon gases like hydrogen could not only lower the bloc’s emissions but also support its energy mix through diversification. As part of the proposals introduced yesterday on gas market reform, the European Commission introduced measures to long-term gas import contracts from extending beyond 2049—alongside a provisional deal to end support for new fossil fuel gas and oil projects under its subsidized Projects of Common Interest program starting from year-end 2029.

In this edition, we take a close look at the surge in U.S. LNG exports that has sent natural gas prices to their highest level in years amid a global energy crisis. World buyers are desperate to find available LNG cargoes, while natural gas experts say the U.S. may have reached an inflection point in its rise as an LNG producer.

However, post-COP26, many felt an air of deflation. Alok Sharma, president of COP26, said: “We’re all well aware that, collectively, our climate ambition and action to date have fallen short on the promises made in [the Paris Agreement on climate change].”

Investors' expectations that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates by the summer of 2022 are rapidly growing as inflation continues to run hot. The consumer price index, the market's preferred inflation metric, has recorded an average increase of 5.4% year-over-year each month since June, driven by a supply chain crunch and rising energy prices.

“The jobs market has a long way to go before it has fully healed,” S&P Global Ratings Chief U.S. Economist Beth Ann Bovino said in a report this week.

In this edition, we take a close look at the Build Back Better Act, the U.S. House of Representatives' new $1.75 trillion reconciliation package and infrastructure bill loaded with major climate and clean energy provisions. Renewable energy developers have welcomed the bill's proposal to expand and extend tax credits for clean power projects.

“The recent pickup in COVID-19 infection rates, particularly abroad and with the detection of several omicron cases in the U.S., increases worries that the U.S. may be heading into another wave this winter… So far, the impact of the current pickup in viral rates on consumer behavior seems to be much lower than previous waves, which suggests people have learned to live with the virus,” Dr. Bovino said in research published today. Nevertheless, “the U.S. economy remained resilient, with consumers seemingly willing to spend despite a pickup in COVID-19 cases—particularly with the detection of several omicron cases in the U.S.—and higher inflation weighing on purchasing power.”

The federal fiscal and policy response to the pandemic insulated credit quality across U.S. public finance. The roughly $1 trillion ($550 billion in new funding) Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, signed into law last month, was another positive development and represents an important shift in funding U.S. infrastructure.

“As the Fed gets ready yet again to ‘taper,’ the U.S. dollar has entered another round of strengthening. Since the start of June 2021, the Dow Jones FXCM Dollar Index, which is designed to measure the broad performance of the U.S. dollar against four developed market currencies, has risen 4%,” Benedek Vörös, director of index investment strategy at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said in a commentary yesterday.

While the U.K., Texas, and California differ dramatically in many capacities, these economies are united in their over-reliance on natural gas for power generation—as the fossil fuel accounts for nearly 40%, 51%, and 48% of their respective energy mixes, according to governmental data. Despite several risks that have threatened natural gas’ viability and reliability for these economies, leaders remain faithful to natural gas for their energy grids’ immediate futures.

In February, Arctic temperatures froze Texas, plunging millions of Americans unaccustomed to frigid cold into darkness with neither heat nor electricity, forced oil, gas, and petrochemical production offline, sent gas prices soaring, and nearly caused system-wide energy grid failures.
