Allocate time to Linkedin instead of spending it on Facebook or Instagram. It is important not to rely solely on traditional job marketplaces.

To achieve this, let's consider my own experience as a digital marketer. Your role is to effectively promote your client's services to their target audience. Similarly, you need to market yourself to your target clients. Develop a marketing strategy for yourself and connect with others who have a positive influence in your field to make your work stand out.

Consistently post updates and content on Linkedin.

Stay persistent and don't lose hope.

With the grace of God, things will turn out well.

Those who want to create a portfolio website can follow this list :)

#Logo - The first thing I saw on a user website was the logo. That is the first attraction of the website. Since the website is done in your name, you can design the name beautiful. You are not a graphic designer but not a problem. There are plenty of sites online where you can make logos. But I think you are a web developer or digital marketer, you should learn basic Photoshop. This will give you a lot of work.

#Slogan - You can use a small butt attractive slogan on the website. The slogan will be the one that brings your work to.

#Banner - You can use a large banner picture on the website. But keep in mind that the picture is your own. Suppose you are working on the laptop you can give it a picture.

#About you - in this section you can write a brief about you. And of course you will use a professional picture. Professional does not mean that you have to take pictures very well. Normal can give a smiling picture and keep in mind that your face can be seen clear.
Keep another download button so that your CV is downloaded in PDF form. This is very important.

#Service - In this section you can make your services beautiful. Service you can do whatever you can. Don't give what you can't. You can get into many problems later.

#Portfio - This time the most important place on the website. You will find basically work through portfolio. Everyone will check your portfolio. Many people make a common mistake, which practice, so give it to the portfolio! Suppose you went to the store. You will notice that the dolls are also displayed in various clothes. Put their best clothes on the display. So that your attraction is awakened. In which store do they see the lowest and less beautiful clothes on the display? Then why do you keep practice in portfolio. Before putting any work in the portfolio, judge yourself. If you think you will buy this job with money or you think the work is good, so you put it in the portfolio. After seeing the job you do not like yourself, why buy another job with the money? If you are a web developer, you can keep your work screenshot or live link. If you are a graphics designer, you can keep a link to work screenshots or dribble beheans. Or if you work in other sectors, you can make a screenshot or better by creating a video that will be your work summary.

#Higher Me - You can put a section by this name. Here you can also keep links in various market places such as Fever, Upwork, etc. Because many people do not have the courage or trust to work outside the market place.

#Testimonial - If you do different things, the client will give you reviews. Some reviews can be kept here with pictures. If you are new, you can keep this section off. However, if you get the review, you will turn on. Seeing this, many people will be relied on to work.

#Blog - This part is very important. You can write about the topic you work. Then your own knowledge will increase and another will understand how good you can at work.

#Communication - You can put a form here so that someone can contact you. You can also keep phone numbers, emails, etc.

You can start your portfolio website this way. The And try to keep the design fairly simple. So that everything can be easily read. Please do not copy anything from another website.

*** This is written in my own experience. The mistake will see the apologies beautifully sight üôÇ"," Without adding new words, rephrase the given text.

#Logo - The initial element that catches the eye on a user's website is the logo. It serves as the first attraction of the website. Since the website represents you, it is important to design the name beautifully. If you are not a graphic designer, there are numerous online sites where you can create logos. However, as a web developer or digital marketer, it would be beneficial to learn basic Photoshop skills, as it will provide you with more opportunities.

#Slogan - Incorporate a small yet captivating slogan on your website. The slogan should reflect the essence of your work.

#Banner - Utilize a large banner image on your website, but ensure that the image is original. For example, if you work with laptops, you can use a picture of a laptop.

#About you - In this section, provide a brief description of yourself. Additionally, include a professional picture of yourself. Remember, professional does not necessarily mean a perfectly taken photograph. A simple smiling picture where your face is clearly visible will suffice. Also, include a download button for your CV in PDF format, as this is crucial.

#Service - This section allows you to showcase your services in an appealing manner. Only include services that you are capable of providing. Avoid offering services that you cannot deliver, as it may lead to complications in the future.

#Portfolio - This is the most significant section of your website. Your portfolio showcases your work. It is essential to avoid a common mistake made by many, which is including irrelevant or subpar work in the portfolio. Treat your portfolio like a store display. Just as a store displays its best clothes, you should display your best work to attract attention. Before adding any work to your portfolio, evaluate it yourself. If you believe that someone would be willing to pay for that work or if you consider it to be of high quality, then include it in your portfolio. If you do not like the work yourself, why would someone else pay for it? If you are a web developer, include screenshots or live links to your work. If you are a graphic designer, include links to work screenshots or platforms like Dribbble and Behance. For other sectors, you can create screenshots or even a video summarizing your work.

#Hire Me - Create a section with this title. Here, you can include links to various marketplaces such as Fiverr, Upwork, etc. This is particularly useful for individuals who may lack the confidence or trust to work outside of these marketplaces.

#Testimonials - If you have received reviews from clients for your work, you can include them in this section along with pictures. If you are new and do not have any reviews yet, you can omit this section. However, once you receive reviews, it is recommended to include them. Positive reviews can instill confidence in potential clients.

#Blog - This section holds great importance. You can write about topics related to your work. This will not only enhance your knowledge but also demonstrate your expertise to others.

#Contact - Include a form in this section to allow visitors to contact you. You can also provide your phone number, email address, and other contact details.

By following these steps, you can create your own portfolio website. It is advisable to keep the design simple and easily readable. Avoid copying content from other websites.

2023-07-06 18:00:32,Post,"Have you noticed the similarities between the Fabrilife and Manfare clothing brands?

I first noticed the similarities between Fabrilife and Manfare a few months ago on Daraz. Fabrilife is one of my favorite brands, but I had never tried Manfare before. However, I saw that Manfare was offering almost the same designs as Fabrilife, but at a slightly lower price point. This similarity was not just limited to one product category; it was present across the board, from t-shirts and joggers to shorts and underwear. Even the wallets were similar!

Yesterday, while scrolling through Daraz, I saw that someone had asked if Fabrilife was a sub-brand of Manfare. Fabrilife responded by saying that Manfare always copies their products.

This got me thinking: why doesn't Fabrilife take legal action against Manfare for copying their designs? What do brand practitioners think about this?

In addition to the potential legal and reputational risks, the copying by Manfare could also impact Fabrilife's sales. If customers are confused about which brand is the original, they may be less likely to buy from Fabrilife. This could lead to lost sales for the company.

However, I saw that Manfare was offering almost the same designs as Fabrilife, but at a slightly lower price point. This similarity was not just limited to one product category; it was present across the board, from t-shirts and joggers to shorts and underwear. Even the wallets were similar!

Yesterday, while scrolling through Daraz, I saw that someone had asked if Fabrilife was a sub-brand of Manfare. Fabrilife responded by saying that Manfare always copies their products.

This got me thinking: why doesn't Fabrilife take legal action against Manfare for copying their designs? What do brand practitioners think about this?

In addition to the potential legal and reputational risks, the copying by Manfare could also impact Fabrilife's sales. If customers are confused about which brand is the original, they may be less likely to buy from Fabrilife. This could lead to lost sales for the company.

However, I noticed that Manfare was offering almost identical designs to Fabrilife, but at a slightly lower price. This similarity was not limited to just one product category; it extended to t-shirts, joggers, shorts, underwear, and even wallets.

Yesterday, while scrolling through Daraz, I came across a question asking if Fabrilife was a sub-brand of Manfare. Fabrilife responded by stating that Manfare consistently copies their products.

This made me wonder why Fabrilife doesn't take legal action against Manfare for copying their designs. I am curious to know what brand practitioners think about this.

Aside from the potential legal and reputational risks, Manfare's copying could also impact Fabrilife's sales. If customers are unsure about which brand is the original, they may be less inclined to purchase from Fabrilife. This could result in lost sales for the company.

Techbhaiya","The last few days social media is very upset, up to social media! Twitter limit the users in the midst of hundreds of posts, and for this, numerous Twitter users began to temporarily disappear. Attitude: This trouble is over then I will come. But the problem was in the meantime some other platforms began to be set up. Bluska is trending long time; A social platform called Spill, originally became popular among the blacks; And the Facebook Twitter rival text based platform threads have emerged for some time. The situation is that people now just talk about another platform on Twitter!

Threads have become terribly popular in a very short time. Threads have been signed up in just 5 hours. Some of the most famous people have already lived there. On the other hand, on Twitter, watching the activity is low. If some people are lightly reduced or their limit is reduced, then the engagement is reduced, it is dimotative for content creators. On the other hand, the threads may not be exposed anymore, but the opportunity to stand the rival in Twitter during the weakest of Twitter has never been opened.

Threads are doing very well to keep users in less time to keep the app running. Look at Bluskai for comparison. They were launched in February. At present, they have 3 thousand users. However, they have made a weightlist of 1.5 million people. Because Bluska is still working on the infrastructure needed to make users. Threads' Facebook and Instagram have already been created very hard infrastructure, for which they have been able to make such a large number of people. 1 million signs up in 12 hours, and no weightlisting or limit was added, all the threads are going on with all.

Why is this trouble on Twitter now? Their official comment was this for some maintenance. However, according to some news reporters, Google Cloud has created infrastructure problems for business conflicts, for which Twitter has been forced to do so. Twitter is dying for some of the wrong decisions taken by Elon Mask to reduce the cost. However, more information will come out in the coming days; The mask's fault may be rather negligible.

Now the talk is going to be a lot of fun ahead. Don't worry about the optimization of the threads. Features may be worried, but that is not big. They will focus on the growth growth of the Grooth. Twitter, on the other hand, is busy with economic and infrastructure optimization. Their population is already there, but a large number of people are dissatisfied with the current situation and many have already gone to places like hive or mastoadon. With a giant rival like Meta, they now have to start heading with the popular population. Threads have a really good opportunity to play!

Techbhaiya","The last few days social media is very upset, up to social media! Twitter limit the users in the midst of hundreds of posts, and for this, numerous Twitter users began to temporarily disappear. Attitude: This trouble is over then I will come. But the problem was in the meantime some other platforms began to be set up. Bluska is trending long time; A social platform called Spill, originally became popular among the blacks; And the Facebook Twitter rival text based platform threads have emerged for some time. The situation is that people now just talk about another platform on Twitter!

Threads have become terribly popular in a very short time. Threads have been signed up in just 5 hours. Some of the most famous people have already lived there. On the other hand, on Twitter, watching the activity is low. If some people are lightly reduced or their limit is reduced, then the engagement is reduced, it is dimotative for content creators. On the other hand, the threads may not be exposed anymore, but the opportunity to stand the rival in Twitter during the weakest of Twitter has never been opened.

Threads are doing very well to keep users in less time to keep the app running. Look at Bluskai for comparison. They were launched in February. At present, they have 3 thousand users. However, they have made a weightlist of 1.5 million people. Because Bluska is still working on the infrastructure needed to make users. Threads' Facebook and Instagram have already been created very hard infrastructure, for which they have been able to make such a large number of people. 1 million signs up in 12 hours, and no weightlisting or limit was added, all the threads are going on with all.

Techbhaiya","Social media has been in an uproar over the past few days. Twitter has imposed limits on its users, resulting in many temporarily disappearing from the platform. Initially, people thought this issue would blow over, but in the meantime, other platforms have gained popularity. Bluska, a trending social platform, has been around for a while. Another platform called Spill, which was originally popular among the black community, has also emerged. Additionally, a text-based platform called Threads, which rivals Facebook and Twitter, has been gaining traction.

Threads has quickly become extremely popular, with thousands of sign-ups in just five hours. Even some famous individuals have already joined the platform. On the other hand, Twitter's activity has decreased, likely due to some users being limited or leaving the platform. This is detrimental to content creators. However, Threads now has the opportunity to surpass Twitter, which is currently at its weakest.

Threads has done an excellent job of attracting users and keeping them engaged in a short amount of time. In comparison, Bluska, which was launched in February, only has 3,000 users despite having a waitlist of 1.5 million people. Threads, on the other hand, has managed to attract 1 million users in just 12 hours without any waitlisting or limits.

The current trouble on Twitter is attributed to maintenance issues according to their official comment. However, some news reporters suggest that Google Cloud's infrastructure problems have caused conflicts, forcing Twitter to take these measures. Twitter is also facing challenges due to Elon Musk's decisions to reduce costs. More information will likely be revealed in the coming days, and it's possible that Musk's role in this issue is minimal.

Looking ahead, Threads seems to have a promising future. While there may be concerns about optimization and features, these are not major issues. Their focus will be on growth. On the other hand, Twitter is busy with economic and infrastructure optimization. Although they already have a large user base, many people are dissatisfied with the current situation and have migrated to platforms like Hive or Mastodon. With a major competitor like Meta, Twitter now needs to attract and retain a popular population. Threads has a great opportunity to thrive in this scenario.

#AnupomMollickIdeas #business","Sanjiv Meta, one of the best business leaders in India, retired from the MD and CEO position of Hindustan Unilever. This is the famous man who once defended Unilever Bangladesh.

Sanjeev Mehta is one of the Global Leaders who follow Business and Leadership Insight Linkedin.

Do you know the funny thing?

When Meht was asked to join Unilever Bangladesh (UBL), he was not interested.

Because at that time, Unilever was stagging in Bangladesh. Tell me who wants to join a Losing business?!

Then his wife said -
‚ÄúWhen will you get the opportunity to turn a Failing Business Turn Around again? If you can do this well, then a new unity will be created for you. ""

Mehta joined Bangladesh in 1998 as a Commercial Director. Losing Business turned around, brought growth.

He was made the chairman of the UBL and the managing director.

In 2002-2006, Unilever became the Crown Jewel of the Unilever Bangladesh Parent Company under the leadership of Mehta.

New roads also opened for Mehta.

He was sent as CEO in the Philippines, North America and Middle East.

In the final 2013, Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) was given the responsibility.

HUL is the largest FMCG company in India. Sanjeev Mehta successfully operated the company in these ten years.

During his leadership, HUL's market capitalization jumps from 17 billion and stands at $ 75 billion.

Sanjeev Mehta's success did not come in that way. I cannot mention two of his extraordinary education.

1. ""Invest in yourself""

Mehta was a Charterd Accountant.

In the beginning he joined the Finance Team at the Union Carbide (UCC) Chemical Corporation.

A few days later the bhopal gas tragedy occurs on the UCC plant. Where 5 Lakh people are exposed to toxic gas, 2000+ die.

The Crisis Response Team, the world's Worst Industrial Disaster, was taken to the youngest member of the 24 -year -old Mehta.

After seeing his performance, he was then given to the business unit.

Mehta went to the boss and said, 'I have to give three weeks off'.

The boss asked, 'Are you going to get married?'

Mehta said - 'No. I would like to learn all the functions of chemical and plastic business, terminology. I'll be in the factory all the time except the shower! '

Many of us do not want to give this level of effect behind learning, so I fall behind in my career!

2. ""There is no shortcut to detail""

At present many CEOs are busy sitting in the AC room to show the presentation, do not visit the market!

But Sanjeev Mehta was the exception.

A few years ago, during the market visits in Bhubaneswar, the capital of Orissa, he noticed that the scent of Lux was getting lost soon.

He informed the R&D team. They researched and realized that this was happening because of the more humidity there!

This extraordinary Attention to Detail - It also makes mehh unique at the product development level.

We can also practice this sincere effort, concentration, self -sacrifice behind the success of successful business.

In our country, there are numerous succesful business leaders.

#Anupommollickideas #business","Sanjiv Meta, a renowned business leader in India, recently retired from his position as MD and CEO of Hindustan Unilever. He gained fame for his defense of Unilever Bangladesh.

Sanjeev Mehta is recognized as a global leader in business and leadership insights on LinkedIn.

Interestingly, when Mehta was initially approached to join Unilever Bangladesh (UBL), he was not interested. This was because Unilever was struggling in Bangladesh at the time. Who would want to join a failing business, right?

However, his wife encouraged him by saying, ""When else will you have the opportunity to turn around a failing business? If you succeed, it will be a great achievement for you.""

In 1998, Mehta joined UBL as a Commercial Director. He successfully turned the failing business around and brought growth. As a result, he was promoted to Chairman and Managing Director of UBL.

From 2002 to 2006, under Mehta's leadership, Unilever Bangladesh became the crown jewel of the parent company.

Mehta's success opened up new opportunities for him. He was appointed CEO in the Philippines, North America, and the Middle East.

Finally, in 2013, he was given the responsibility of leading Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL), the largest FMCG company in India. Mehta successfully operated the company for ten years, during which HUL's market capitalization increased from $17 billion to $75 billion.

Mehta's success can be attributed to two key factors. Firstly, he believed in investing in himself. He started his career as a Chartered Accountant and joined the Finance Team at Union Carbide (UCC) Chemical Corporation. After the Bhopal gas tragedy, he was appointed to the Crisis Response Team, showcasing his exceptional performance. This led to his transition to the business unit.

Secondly, Mehta emphasized the importance of paying attention to detail. Unlike many CEOs who prefer to stay in their air-conditioned offices, Mehta made it a point to visit the market. During one of his visits to Bhubaneswar, he noticed that the scent of Lux was fading quickly. He immediately informed the R&D team, who discovered that the humidity in the area was causing this issue. This attention to detail also translated into his approach to product development.

Mehta's success serves as an inspiration for aspiring business leaders in our country, where there are numerous successful individuals in the field.",Small Businesses,BrandPractitionersBD,https://www.facebook.com/groups/753737631372928,"- Sanjiv Mehta
